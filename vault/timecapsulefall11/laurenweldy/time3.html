<center><font face="century gothic" size="2" color="#cc0033">Two significant movies that i've seen thus far in my life are the movies <i>Never Back Down</i> &<i> A Walk to Remember</i>. <i>Never Back Down</i> is about a rebellious guy who is new to a high school and is lured into an underground fight club where he finds a mixed martial arts veteran to mentor him. <i>A Walk to Remember</i> is a story of two North Carolina teens, Landon Carter and Jamie Sullivan, who are thrown together after Landon gets into trouble and is made to do community service. Jamie and Landon fall and love and soon after Jamie dies from leukemia. </font></center>

	<font face="Perpetua" size="3" color="#cc0033">One significant piece of literature that i've read in my lifetime that i was very drawn to was<i> The Last Song</i> by Nicholas Sparks which is about Ronnie, whos life was turned around when her parents divorced and her father moved from New York City to Wilmington, North Carolina. Three years later, she remained angry and alienated from her parents, especially her father… until her mother decides it would be in everyone’s best interest if she spent the summer with him. Ronnie’s father is focused on creating a song that will become the centerpiece of a local church. The tale that unfolds is an unforgettable love story.</font></center>
