Happiness reminds me of all the things that have made me smile or laugh as i have grown up. It reminds me of my child hood and things i've gone through. Some of the things that make me happy is being on the softball diamond; being on the mound, up to bat, with my teammates, and having my family on the other side of the fence cheering me on. Happiness is when you're in a content state, not just because of money or the materialistic things but because of the people surrounding you and who you become throughout life that makes you happy and able to say "i'm proud of who i am" in the end. </font>

					<b><font face="century gothic" size="2" color="#ccffcc"> 	As of now in 2011, I'm planning on graduating and pursuing a career in Nursing at Grand Valley State University. I plan on playing 4 years of softball as either a pitcher, 3rd baseman, or hitter at this college. After all this schooling is over with I hope i pull through with a good money making job that i enjoy. I plan on getting married and having 3 children. Hopefully 2 boys and a girl. I thank God I'm living in a decently good home and not struggling to get by day by day. Maybe the world actually won't end and throw all of my dreams down the drain. I'm anxious to see who I am married to 10 years from now, what I name my kids, and where my brother ends up in life. Hopefully he has great things going in life. I hope my parents at this time of my life haven't killed eachother yet and are very successful and happy wherever they are in life at this point in time.</br>
 <p>
 <br>
 Right now, I'm attending Grandville High School. My dream is to be in the medical field as a nurse and visit Africa and poor areas in the world and help them with sickness and learn the culture from my own perspective. Lately, I've been doing great in getting my grades up to all A's and I got a job at Marshalls. I decided not to play basketball this year which as of now isn't too much of a regret. I've spent my time training for softball and working out, working, and spending time with my friends and boyfriend. It's Wednesday, November 30 and <font color="#ffff66">THERE'S NO SNOW YET! </font>What the heck is this? Lansing gets 9 inches and we have to deal with this nasty cold weather but don't get snow? We better get snow soon. I visited SVSU 2-3 weeks ago and am visiting GVSU next tuesday. Did I really end up at GVSU? My mom is in New York City at the moment with her boyfriend, Terry. Lucky her! Where am I? Back in school. Best of luck to you these next few years, I hope your dreams really do come true.

Of course, i can do anything i want to no matter what any one says but do i want that? No. I want people there to guide me in my life and to direct me to follow the right path. I have the freedom to wear what i want, pursue a career of my choice, and marry the man of my choice. I feel that freedom is a huge part in life because without freedom, i feel there wouldn't be much of a way to learn lessons and make mistakes because you'd be caught up with no freedom to mess up. Life is about messing up, learning from your mistakes and either fixing them and changing your ways or continuing to screw up. Once a mistake has been made once, the second time it happens it becomes a choice. Without freedom, the world would be a nasty place.

It's not all about whether you get knocked down or how often you mess up. It's whether you get up again and how you react to the negatives. You must have long term goals to keep you from being frustrated by short term failures; most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there seemed to be no hope at all." </font>
