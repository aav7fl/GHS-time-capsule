	   <P>Technology.. What to say about it.. It has gone far, that is for sure. From the Nintendo Gamecube, to the Wii, and now the XBox Kinect.. I hear that within the next years or so you won't even need a TV or controller at 
			all. It will simply be a projector and motion sensor. I bet you anything someday they will have a full simulator for you--I've read Sci-Fi books that have things like that. A technology that sends your brain into the game 
			so that you are almost literally in the game yourself. Perhaps even a ginormous simulation room, like in Ender's Game, but much more complex and visual.

		 <p>Daily life must assuredly be different. I wonder if books will even be around anymore. We already have the iPad 2, Kindle Fire, Nook Color, etc. Quite honestly I cannot possibly guess what may be around by now. I can 
			remind you of the current technological state of today. The high school uses Windows 7, all are HP computers. The latest iPhone was 4S, and there is a new one coming out quite soon. The annoucement of new gaming consoles 
			say they will be a projector and motion detector. Landlines are still around. The iPad 2 is one of the most popular electronic currently...  </p>

		 <P>I wonder what the movies will be like now... The best we have is a thing called RealD (3D with reduced effects to make it more realistic)... Not that great. Do you remember IMAX? Coffee makers? Coolest we have are things 
			like Keurig. What strange thing are you using to listen to music these days? What is used to create art? A new type of tablet? It all must be very fascinating. I bet you also feel old. When you were a kid the gamecube had 
			just come out, as did the internet, and cell phones--big chunky plugged into car cell phones.. Cars... Must be fascinating these days.  <p>
