	   <P>Maybe I have brought up some hard memories for you to dwell on. However, I know from experience it is better to remember
		    something, even bad memories, than nothing at all. Everything I <i>can</i> remember allows me to heal personally and
				learn something.
	
		 <P>At the time this was written you had many problems. Panic attacks, anxiety, stress 24/7, compulsive scratching, hyper-
		    ventilating, etc. You couldn't name a single thing you enjoyed/appreciated about yourself. Please, think about it.
				List the things you like about yourself and dwell on that. Would you rather be happy or spend all your time trying to 
				conform to society's pathetic standards?  
		 
		 <P>Since I doubt that anyone I should ever see again let me remind you of things other people said they loved about you.
		    Your eyes. Eyes that turn bright turquoise when you cry, but usually a gray-blue. On some ocassions they would be gray
				or even green. You had significantly larger pupils than most--that or they were always dilated. It gave you a 
				inquisitive, intelligent look. Your hair. You never had to straighten it. The most you would do is brush it and go to 
				school with it wet. It would stay straight every time. Even when you would try to curl it, it would go back to straight
				within the hour. Your wisdom. More than once people have told you that you are wise beyond your years. Maturity. Same 
				thing,  you have always been very mature for your age. 
			
			<P>Dwell on those things! Don't let other people get you down. They set their standards high because they think poorly of 
			   themselves. Encourage them, even those who are mean to you. Smile, give compliments, make eye contact and keep your chin 
				 up. It will do miracles.
			
			<p>Your family loves you, your horse adores you, the doggies <i>can't</i> stand it when you leave, and most of God loves you.
			<p>I pray to God that by now you have learned to love yourself.Good luck, old friend. </p>

				<p>"Oh, the comfort, the inexpressible comfort of feeling safe with a person, having neither to weigh thoughts nor measure words, but pouring them all 
				out, just as they are, chaff and grain together, certain that a faithful hand will take and sift them, keep what is worth keeping, and with a breath of 
				kindness blow the rest away."  ~Dinah Craik

		 <p>"Do not plant your dreams in the field of indecision, where nothing ever grows but the weeds of 'what-if.'"  ~Dodinsky
		 <p>"That which the dream shows is the shadow of such wisdom as exists in man, even if during his waking state he may know nothing about it.... We do not 
				know it because we are fooling away our time with outward and perishing things, and are asleep in regard to that which is real within ourself."
