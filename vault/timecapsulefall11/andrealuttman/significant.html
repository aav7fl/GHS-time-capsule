		      <p><strong>Significant Piece of Literature</strong></p><p>I can think of a few really significant pieces of literature that are really enjoyable to read. One of those is the book <i>The Giver</i> by Lois Lowry. This 
					book really makes you think about all the ever so simple things we take foregranted--color, memories, weather, choices, etc. That makes the book most significant to me. However, there is a corrupt hint behind it. 
					Sometimes I wonder when this type of thing will take place in our world."The Giver is many things to many different people. People bring to it their own complicated sense of beliefs and hopes and dreams and fears and 
					all of that." ~Lois Lowry

              <p><strong>Significant Film/Play</strong><br> I cannot think of one that may stand the "test of time". However, I can think of many that are significant to me. <i>Inception</i> from 2010. What ideas are you putting 
							into their heads and haev you ever considered what it may do to their future. What we say and do affects people? Does the end justify the means?... <i>Source Code</i> from 2011. What can we justify for the sake of 
              others' lives? What do we mean when we say we've done "enough"? Have we really? <i>Schindler's List</i>(1993) and <i>The Pianist</i>(2002). Never forget. The things that happened. History is that which repeats 
							itself.

		      <p><strong>Significant Quote</strong><br><i>"My horse teaches me everything that I need to know about myself."</i><br>Maybe it is not significan to most people, as in most I mean 95%. However, to me and and anyone else 
					who has owned a horse and truly loved horses--it is not a quote. It is the honest to God truth.It is the story of my life and I would not have it any other way. Horses are a mirror for those it has bonded with. It 
					shares your fears, confidence, insecurities, victories, failures, etc. Through it all they are still your best friend. By now you better be passing this quote out through Equine-Assisted Psychotherapy.

		     <p><strong>Significant Song<br>When I'm Alone by Nevertheless</strong><br>"It's been years in the making, in my skin I am shaking from the cold.I am tired from the taking, my heart won't stop breaking and I 
         know...Moving forward can't be this hard.I'm just trying to find out who I am on my own. I had you right beside me, but now you're gone and I know...That when the room clears, I'm still here--Who am I when I'm 
				 alone? They say time is a healer, but it's more like a concealer for a scar. It never really leaves us, but it can always find us where we are. Who thought it could be so hard? I'm just trying to find out who I am on my 
				 own. I had you right beside me, but now you're gone and I know...That when the room clears, I'm still here, who am I when, the rrom clears, I'm still here, who am I, the room clears, I'm still here, when I'm alone?"
