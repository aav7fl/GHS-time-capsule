	   <P>Remember when you thought high school was like hell. Got teased, made fun of, and barely made it through the day. Heck! 
				It has been ten years, why do you remember all that crap anyways? Your idea of fun was sitting in your room alone with 
				your laptop on your bed. A good vacation meant cleaning stalls, riding, and playing Zelda. The perfect snack was a cold 
				Arnold Palmer and a bag of Act II Movie Theatre Butter popcorn. Life was not horrible, but man, you were not doing so 
				hot near the end of it. You wrote this the day after a emotional break down. You did not want to get up, but you did. 
				Went to school, just to get harshly called an idiot for an innocent opinion. Yeah, that is teenagers for you... 
				Judgemental, egocentric, and overall jerks.
	
		 <P>Yet during it all, you had some really good times too. You had Rittz during your junior year. Yes, he was a crazy 
			nut-case.However, he got you through one year of school. That same summer you got your horse (totally a pony), Pocos 
			Classy Sunsue aka Classy. All through your junior year and some of senior year you could not canter her to save your 
			life. This past weekend, November 26, 2011. You did it. Not a hint of fearin you anymore, just pure will. You were about to 
			move in with your dad and Cindy. The house is huge, too good to be true... I hope you still live there (well at least they 
			do, you should have your own place by now). Done with college too, huh? Lucky you, I am barely getting there. 
		 
		 <P>Secretely, I hope you never find anyone. You are better off without them... You are such a free spirit. You need to be 
			out in the open and isolated. It is true you know, I know you better than you. It may not make sense now, but I can tell 
			you every one of your secret weak spots, things that drive you crazy, things you love... Relationships set you up for a 
			bunch of crap. Even when you had a good one with no problems, you could not handle being tied to someone else. Be free, 
			for once in your life. Go, go out and do things. Travel the world. Revisit Thailand and REMEMBER. You never did have a 
			good memory.. Always forgetting stuff... Forgetting really important things. 
			
			<P>Your promise ring, do you still wear it? It was the last thing you got from them both before mom and dad got divorced. 
			It was on your thirteenth birthday, at P.F. Changs. How is Classy? Give her a good grooming for me. I often miss her, 
			being so far away.. Friends? Do you have many? If not, who cares! you never really did, and you were still very happy. 
			You are very different from many people--never forget it. Even when no one understands you, you are not alone. You have Dad, 
			Mom, Cindy, and especially Classy. 
			
			<p>Do not even dare forget our goal. To help people and horses all in one. Equine Assisted Psychotherapy.If you have 
			forgotten it, REMEMBER it. Horses were the only one who kept you sane all through your life. It is time with you to share 
			that with othe broken teens. Teens who are  broken, struggling, and about to give up. Save them. You will save yourself in 
			doing so.
			<p>Not much else for me to say really... Maybe you will never actually read this. You never were the type to go to reunions 
			and stuff like that. With that said.. Good luck! Go live life and regret nothing! </p>

       Happiness...Happiness is when you are accepting of yourself and the current situation, you don't simply tolerate it, but 
				find the best within it. It cannot be found within yourself though, it is found through other people and other 
				surroundings. "Happiness is always a by-product.  It is probably a matter of temperament, and for anything I know it may be 
				glandular.  But it is not something that can be demanded from life, and if you are not happy you had better stop worrying 
				about it and see what treasures you can pluck from your own brand of unhappiness."  ~Robertson Davies

		 <div id="extra">
		 <p>Freedom...Freedom is not doing whatever you want whenever you want where ever you want (Even if that would be 
			nice...)It is seeing your current situation and know the following: it is because of what you've done, you can change it, 
			you have the opportunity to shape it, but it takes work to get there."There are two freedoms - the false, where a man is free 
			to do what he likes; the true, where he is free to do what he ought."  ~Charles Kingsley
