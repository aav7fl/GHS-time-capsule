					<p>Dear <strong>Dianna,</strong> Somethings may never change. Others
					will. That all depends on your idead of change, now doesn't it. 
					I think I find it easy to write a letter to myself/you since I talk 
					to myself so much. You may not remember just how much you did that. 
					Here's a hint; A LOT. You know why it became such a common occurance. 
					I'll update you on what's been going on in your/my life so far.
							 <li>Piano was changed this week so that it was on Tuesday instead
							 of Monday and Dad got confused and called it Job's twice.</li>
							 <li> You're working on a Harry Potter Character's Song video on 
							 Movie Maker and your shoulder hurts really bad.</li>
							 <li> At this moment in time, you are sitting on your foot in 6th
							 hour Web Design typing this and listening to some song you've 
							 never heard the name of and your foot is falling asleep</li>
							 <li>You are getting ready to be Honored Queen of Grand Rapids 
							 Bethel.</li>
					</p>
					<p>Oh, and another thing I forgot to mention. Samatha Kelley is 
					sitting beside you and calls you weird for being obssessed with Star Wars
					as she uses Twilight for every idea she gets. Explain that one.

					<h2><span>Quotes from People</span></h2>
					<ul>
						"Don�t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and 
						go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.�
						~ Howard Thurman
						<hr>
						�There comes a time when you have to stand up and shout:
						This is 		me damn it! I look the way I look, think the way I think, feel the 
						way I feel, love the way I love! I am a whole complex package. Take 
						me... or leave me. Accept me - or walk away! Do not try to make me 
						feel like less of a person, just because I don't fit your idea of who 
						I should be and don't try to change me to fit your mold. If I need to change, 
						I alone will make that decision. When you are strong enough to 
						love yourself 100%, good and bad - you will be amazed at the 
						opportunities that life presents you.� ~ Stacy Charter
