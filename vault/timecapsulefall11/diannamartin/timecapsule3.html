					<p>The Luxe Series</p>
					<p>It's a series of four books set in Manhatten in 1899. It's a romantic comedy with no action 
					but I still like it. It's wierd for me to like something like that. I usually read things that
					have action in them, but I still liked this and there was no action invovled. Rumors was my favorite
					and I haven't read Envy yet. I've discovered that I can't read them in quick sucession because I'll get
					either too invovled or end up hating the books. I haven't touched them in about two years. I really should 
					get on that since the fourth one is out.

					<p>Star Wars Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace</p>
					The one everyone over looks constantly. People always say this was the worst of the movies. I say "Let's focus on the 
					good things"! <p>
					<li>New Planets - The galaxy's not limited to Alderaan, Hoth, Yavin, Tatooine, and Endor anymore. There's Couruscant, Naboo, and 
					the return of Tatooine. It was the first glimps of a larger galaxy before the revised ROTJ came out. It was awesome.</li></p>
					<li>Jedi - More Jedi! That's cool. They have their own system. We can see how they worked before the Empire rose. I don't 
					know about you, but I found it was interesting.</li><p>
					<li>Jar Jar Binks - People are always saying how annoyed with him they got. But he was important, if obnoxious. 
					He took Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon to Theed, he got Padm� in to ask for the Gugans help. He was also a stress releaver. 
					And, if he hadn't been in the first movie, they would've had a continuity fail when they had him vote the Executive powers
					to the Chancellor.</li></p>
					<p><li>Young Obi-Wan - I like Ewan McGregor. He did excellent job as the younger Obi-Wan. He is someone you could see growing up
					to be Alec Guinness. Plus, now all the Star Wars junkies have someone to tie up in their mediphorical closet. That includes me.</li></p>
					<p><li>Padm� Naberrie Amidala - The moment she and Anakin met, everyone watching knew who she was. The twins' mother. Yay! It's nice to 
					know who she is, instead of her being some random woman. They actually knew each other and he wasn't a bad guy yet when the twins were 
					born. It's sort of releaving.</li></p>
					<p><li>Handmaidens -  I feel the need to mention them, and not just because I like to speculate. There was Sab�, Padm�'s decoy and who was
					pretending to be the Queen during the invasion. Yan�, Rab�, and Sach� were also people. Yan� and Sach� stayed on Naboo during the movie, but 
					they were in the ending bits, so we know they didn't die. Eirta� is often called "the blonde handmaiden". All the handmaidens are supposed to
					look like who they're serving so that they can act as decoy's. So they all had brown hair and eyes except for Eirta�, who was blonde with blue 
					eyes, and Dan�, who had red hair. F� was probably supposed to be a stand in for Sach� or Rab� but became a new character instead. Seh follows
					the physical descriptions of the others excepting Erita� and Dan�.</li></p>
					<p>Star Wars Episode 2 - Attack of the Clones</p>
					What I like to call :the ackward story". As my dad pointed out, Anakin was a teenager. As a general rule, they are ackward. That and George
					Lucas is bad at love scenes anyway. We finally see the realationships between Anakin and Palpatine, Anakin and Obi-Wan, Anakin and the Jedi,
					and Anakin and Padm�. It becomes apparent why it was easy for Anakin to kill the Jedi but not Obi-Wan until he became Darth Vader. I feel the 
					need to list the new things in this one as well. 
					<p><li>Jar Jar binks - Not really new, but still. I think it was good for him to be in this one. It made us feel connected to the story and the
					characters to have Jar Jar make the movement for Palpatine to have the Executive Powers. I don't think anyone focuses on how he functions in the
					story. They only pay attention tot he fact that he's annoying and obnoxious.</li></p>
					<p><li>Handmaidens - There's new ones. Cord�, who died at the beginning and is one of the three who have speaking lines. Vers�, she died in the explosion
					 that killed Cord�. Her actress isn't even listed in the credits. Dorm�, she makes three with speaking lines. She stayed behind on Couruscant when Padm� 
					 and Anakin went to Naboo in an attempt to throw the assassin off the trail. All of them had brown hair and eyes as well.</li></p>
					 <li><p>Owen and Beru - Hey, they're back! And they aren't dead! Bonnie Piesse is so cute as Beru. I've also discovered, and created!, 
					 the pairing of Obi-Wan and Beru. I think they're so cute.</li></p>
					<p>Star Wars Episode 3 - Revenge of the Sith</p>
					Main thing about Episodio 3. The return of Vader. It's awesome and beautiful and sad at the same time. It's the end of the saga. There are 
					more hamdmaidens for Padm�. Mote�, who was her decoy and also knew about her pregnancy and marriage to Anakin, and Ell�, who knew about her pregnacy 
					but may or may not have know about her marriage. I like this one. It's my favorite. But I don't know why because I hated certain parts of it 
					when it first came out, but know I watch it whenever I have time. The five minute scene at the end where Obi-Wan hands Luke to Beru was 
					enough to get a couple out of. I'm so weird.</p>

					<p>Happy by Leona Lewis</p>
					<br>
						Someone once told me that you have to choose</br>
					<br>What you win or lose</br>
					<br>You can't have everything</br>
					<br>Don't you take chances</br>
					<br>Might feel the pain</br>
					<br>Don't you love in vain</br>
					<br>Cause love won't set you free</br>
					<br>I can't stand by the side</br>
					<br>And watch this life pass me by</br>
					<br>So unhappy</br>
					<br>But safe as could be</br>

						
					<br>So what if it hurts me?</br>
					<br>So what if I break down?</br>
					<br>So what if this world just throws me off the edge</br>
					<br>My feet run out of ground</br>
					<br>I gotta find my place</br>
					<br>I wanna hear my sound</br>
					<br>Don't care about all the pain in front of me</br>
					<br>Cause i'm just trying to be happy, yeah</br>
					<br>Just wanna be happy, yeah</br>

						
					<br>Holding on tightly</br>
					<br>Just can't let it go</br>
					<br>Just trying to play my role</br>
					<br>Slowly disappear, ohh</br>
					<br>But all these days, they feel like they're the same</br>
					<br>Just different faces, different names</br>
					<br>Get me out of here</br>
					<br>I can't stand by your side, ohh no</br>
					<br>And watch this life pass me by, pass me by</br>

						
					<br>So what if it hurts me?</br>
					<br>So what if I break down?</br>
					<br>So what if this world just throws me off the edge</br>
					<br>My feet run out of ground</br>
					<br>I gotta find my place</br>
					<br>I wanna hear my sound</br>
					<br>Don't care about all the pain in front of me</br>
					<br>Cause i'm just trying to be happy, ohh, happy, ohh</br>

						
					<br>So many turns that I can't see,</br>
					<br>like I'm a stranger on this road</br>
					<br>But don't say victim</br>
					<br>Don't say anything</br>

						
					<br>So what if it hurts me?</br>
					<br>So what if I break down?</br>
					<br>So what if this world just throws me off the edge</br>
					<br>My feet run out of ground</br>
					<br>I gotta find my place</br>
					<br>I wanna hear my sound</br>
					<p>Don't care about all the pain in front of me</p>

						
					<br>I just wanna be happy</br>
					<br>Ohh, yeah, happy, ohh, happy</br>
					<br>I just wanna be, ohh</br>
					<br>I just wanna be happy</br> 
					<br>Ohh, happy</br>
