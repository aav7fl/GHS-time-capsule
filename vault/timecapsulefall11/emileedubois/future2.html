    <h2>My Definitions</h2>
    <h3>My definition of happiness is having the entire Dubois family in one house, eating food, and being happy together. There is nothing I look forward to more than Christmas lunch, fellowshipping with my family. My family has expanded this year, and I'm sure it will be larger in ten years, if God blesses us like that. Sheer happiness is what I have when all ten of us are at the table, and pray. I am so grateful I was born into this God honoring home, and that we can all praise God together. <br></br>
My definition of freedom? I don't know, I've never really felt enslaved. My parents give me freedom, and haven't restrained me from anything unless it is bad for me. One day I hope to live alone, and paint and eat fruit, but I don't think I define that as freedom. I feel free right now. My most important relationship is that between me and the Father, and I don't feel enslaved there. I may be oblivious, but I don't think I am struggling with a major sin issue, so I don't feel enslaved that way either. Being alive is my definition of freedom.<br></br> </h3><h2>Predictions</h2><h3>
I have no idea what technology will be like in ten years. I barley understand it now. Currently, Ipods and Iphones are the "big thing." A lot of movies are released 3D, and that just gives me a headache. There is a lot of voice command and facial recognition junk going on, so that could take off more. Maybe there will be more holographic things in the future, like Princess Leah in Star Wars. Computers could be touch screen. Students will be given Ipods and laptops instead of books. All grocery stores will have automatic cashiers, and shopping will be done virtual. I think that technology will just keep advancing to the point that humans have so many luxuries that we won't have to do anything, like in Wall-E. Part of me is worried Dad may loose his job because technology is advancing so much, they may not have anything for him to do any more. <br></br>
