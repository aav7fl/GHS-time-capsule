<p><strong></strong> <p>My favorite book of all time is probably "The Invention of Hugo Cabret" by Brian Selznick. 
<p>This is the EXTREMELY MAGICAL tale of Hugo Cabret, an orphan living alone in the walls of the Paris train station durring the 1930s. A few years earlier, Hugo's father was killed when a fire engulfed the museum he worked at, forcing Hugo to live with his drunken, and frequently absent Uncle Cluade, who works as the clock keeper at the Train Station. But, when Uncle Claude goes missing, Hugo must fend for himself in the station. 
<p>He encounters a broken down man known as Papa Georges, and his god-daughter, Isabell, and together, the two (Hugo and Isabelle), embark on an AMAZING journey to uncopver a message from Hugo's father, which is hidden in a automation, a robotic man. They also uncover a secret from Papa Georges' past, and set out to restore the man to his former glory. </p>
<p> Why do I love this book? It's use of sketches and words to tell it's magical story. Brian Selznick's sketches are possibly the most beautiful ones I have ever seen. I ADORE THIS BOOK!!!!!! </p></p> </p> </p>

<p><strong></strong> <p>My prediction of technology in the future is that technology is sure to be FAR more interactive. I believe that video games will be FAR MORE immersive. With the X-Box Kinect and the PlayStation Move, we are getting PRETTY DANG CLOSE to getting that. I think that we WILL be the video game. I think that FaceBook will be far more immersive. I can't really describe what I mean by that, but I think it will DEFFINATELY be more immersive. iPods will be far more compact, and may or may not be holographic. </p> 
<p> My FAVORITE MOVIE of ALL TIME is "Avatar", which is CURRENTLY the highest grossing film of all time. I love the visuals, and the way that James Cameron created a truly mezmerizing world in the form of Pandora </p></p>
<p>Right now, the album that has had the BIGGEST impact on my life is "Gravity Happens" by Kate Voegele. I am almost DEFINATE that when you are reading this, this is STILL going to be your favorite album. It is SO AMAZING! To me, I can relate to this album SO MUCH.I hope that even though it's been two years, I hope you haven't forgotten about Kate Voegele! If you have, I feel bad for you :(</p>  </p>
