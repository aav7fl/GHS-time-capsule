<h2>Letter to the Future...</h2>
<h3 class="sub"></h3>
<p>Wow, it sure has been a long time since you sat in Mr. Dolloff's 5th Hour Intro to <s>Web Design</s> Bubble Shooter with John Baker, and did mostly nothing, except for an occassional webpage now and then.  Ahhh, the memories...  As you finished this time capsule, you still had no idea what you wanted to do with the rest of your life, that grade in Honors Algebra II was still borderline miserable, and everything was just going pretty good.  Now that you're older, all of those high school memories look like just a tiny little blimp in the rearview mirror of life. You're done with college, you've met some great new friends, and moved on to a full- time job doing who knows what.  You worked really hard to get wherever you're at now, and you still have your whole life ahead of you.  Just remember, you only live this life once, so go out and make the most of it.</p>

<h4>"Lead me, follow me, or get out of my way!"-George Patton</h4>

<h3>Happiness</h3>

Happiness is simply having fun doing what you love the most.
<h3>Freedom</h3>

Freedom is having control of your life and your actions, and living it the way you want.

<h3>Technology</h3>

I have no idea what the future has in store for technology as we knew it in 2011, but I think by the time this is read, technology will be making our everyday lives easier and more efficient in ways we couldn't have even imagined.
