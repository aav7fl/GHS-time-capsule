		   <big>Dear myself (beautiful piece of living),</big>
	<p>W<big>ell at this point you're probably 27, if you actually remembered to look at this on time which isn't very likely. First off I'm happy you survived 12/21/12 and 9/4/15. By now I hope you are married or at least almost married and pretty rich.  If you're not married or almost married you shall finally drop your standards but make sure he's rich, and if you're not rich then he needs to be double rich.  I don't know about kids, but I'm thinking you need to get started before you're 30.  I hope you're enjoying your career and you chose something really dope. Weird to think it's been 10 years since you were chillin in dollofs class playing bubble shooter with Alicia mocking you for being ugly, Ashley singing, David talking about credit cards, and Torrance hatin on life. I hope the fams doing swell maybe tam is actually married by meow, renees only been married once and hasn't been diagnosed with depression, chad went to college and made tit big, sarah finally leaves high school, daddy hit the lotto, rons not on drugs, and hal turned out normal and not like sarah, and Tom and charles are doing marvelous and you guys still keep in touch. Chances of basically any of this happening are about 0 but you never know. Woah it's like 2021, dang. Anywayy maybe by meow you got over yourself and stopped being a bertch to the whole fam.  That probs didn't happen either but whatevaaaa. Hmm I hope you are still friends with anne! If not you should call her right meow. Minners is probably dead 9 don't wanna think about that omg maybe nikko is tooooooo!  I hope you stopped stressing out about stupid stuff all of the time and are still a happy annoying betch. Oh! And you better not be fat… if you are you need to go the gym now. If you are over 150 I suggest you stop eating and never eat again.  Back to the rich thing I hope you have a really nice house, and I mean really nice! Maybe Chad anne or renee or all 3 live in the basement.  Hopefully you took Dave Ramseys baby steps!!!! And you bought tam that cruise you promised seeming you are her investment. Lets hope you haven't taken on any "bad habits", you better still be going out having a dope time though.  That wouldn't be mcgoodis. Make sure you're taking your vitamins because your old and don't be tanning to much you don't need skin cancer.  Maybe you stopped being so ADD and your chubby fingers shrank so your wedding ring isn't effing huge! An if you are married lets hope he's hottis. Otherwise I'm disappointed.  I toats mah goats hope you are still close with the famis! Eff beee better still be something everyone does, otherwise that must be a sad life.  I hope you are having mctroubis reading all of these dope words you learned from alice an such.  And you notice how choppy an aweful this is but remember how you were to lazy to do anything about tit.  Hmm I wonder twat the futures like. Omggg maybe your hair turned curly by meow like tammys!!!!! Omg I sure hope so, otherwise you might need a perm or sumfin, idk that may be riskkayy.  Your life better not be boring and dull and if it is you need to go skydiving or some shet. I am not going to have some boring dull worrisome stressed out life.  Even though you are constantly stressed. All in all I hope you're still happy, loud, annoying, weird, funny, dope, cheerful, optimisitic, perfect, do what you want when you want, and yeah all that shtuffff yah mean! The last thing I want to say is no matter what you go through and how much you change, make sure every person you ever were is still a part of you, and you learn from everything. Everything happens for a reason, change sucks but it's a part of life.</big>
<p><big>Love,</big></p>
<p><big>You at Seventeen</big></p>
