		  Dear Future Self, <br>
			I hope life is good and just as amazing as I am picturing it now. It's been 10 years so you have to be what.. 26 years old? I hope you're married by now. If you're not, God help you. As of this moment in 2011, I am planning on going to Western Michigan University and pursuing a career in psychology. If any of this is true, I hope you are happy and the schooling was well worth it. I hope college was awesome, that's all I keep thinking about. I hope you make a lot of money, because if you don't then I hope you married into a lot of money. And if neither of these are true, please just do us both a favor and shoot yourself already. I hope Dane, Dad, and Mom are well. Please tell me none of them died yet. I hope you remember how sarcastic you were in high school because I'm totally kidding. All in all, I hope you are happy and every decision-good and bad- you made helped you in some way. I'm anxious to read this when I'm you someday, because I can't wait to see how things have changed and how far along I've come. God I hope I'm not a screw up, because if I am, it's definiately your fault.<br>
Anyway, enough about you, let's talk about me, your beautiful, flawless, 16 year-old self. I am in my junior year of high school, at good ol' Grandville. (Gag) I am currently in my web design class with Mr. Dolloff who is awesome! My only friends in this class are Lauren Weldy and Nikki Steenwyk. If you don't talk to them anymore, you probably should start again. Let's see what else... Dane's a senior this year, and Coco's still around... Dad's working for Blattner Energy, Inc., and I'm taking Annie to Mall of America this year for his business trip. Dane isn't going :( Butthead. I went to France this summer, as I'm sure you remember. I hope we get to go again after I graduate and if we did I hope it was even better than last time. Hhmm... Oh yeah, I work at Uccello's there in Standale, I hope that's still around... I drive a 2006 Jeep Liberty.. Life pretty much sucks in 2011. I'm really scared to take the ACT, I hope I do good on it... I'm pretty excited for senior year, and to get out of this hell-hole. Yeah you should probably remember that you had a potty mouth... And probably still do :) I honestly hope you aren't reading this saying how much you miss high school... Even though you probably are. I hope you are actually reading this and that these aren't stuck in Cyber-Siberia for the rest of eternity. I can't wait to read this someday and smile. Hope all is well in the future. Tell hubby I said Hi. Mwah.<p>
