Facebook is a social networking site. It has become very popular throughout the years and is the best way to connect with people these days. I really hope you still don't have your Facebook from high school, because if you do I am disappointed. Facebook is lame and I hope it doesn't turn out like MySpace did.

Twitter is another social networking site, but is less popular than Facebook. I bet by now it's either more popular than Facebook or maybe even outdated? Anyway, Twitter is much more simple than Facebook and is better in my opinion. I hope you still use Twitter because if you do, you should tweet about this later.

<h2>How has technology evolved since 2011??</h2><p>
Well, I hope by now they've invented hover-craft cars... Just kidding. But that'd be cool. I'm hoping that they've at least found an alternative to gas for powering cars.. I think Google invented a car that drives itself just this past year or so, so I wonder how that has evolved? I kinda hope everything's touch screen now, like TVs, cars, computers, etc. I wonder if "Smart Phones" are completely outdated?? Right now I have a Droid Pro so I wonder what kind of cell phones are out now? Probably more based on the iPad, but smaller..? Are iPads outdated?? That's kind of the newest technology we have right now as for gadgets.. I think it'd be sweet if refridgerators had a computerized list in them of what you need to buy at the store. Unless robots do all of the grocery shopping now... Just kidding. I hope you're not fat and lazy. But I do kinda hope we have a robot maid, that'd be pretty awesome. I bet anything things are pretty much the same except for a couple cool new gizmos. But I bet technology in the schools have come pretty far though. No more overheads I hope? Right now in some of my classes, we have the "ELMO" which is basically a data projector kind of thing.. We also have "Smart Boards" which are touch screen white boards. I wonder if high schools are giving out laptops/"notebooks" to students more ferquently? They just started doing that recently, but I hope they're doing that for every high school now. Probably not, because we're poor. I wonder how laptops are now. Probably all touch screen, am I right? I hope we have some sweet stuff in 2021.. (I hope it's 2021 when you read this)
