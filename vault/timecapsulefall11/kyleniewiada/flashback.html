			Dear Kyle Niewiada,</br>
It's not as if I haven't done this before.  Recall the email time capsules that spanned 5 years?  Anyways, how's the page look?  Are all of the elements still working with our current HTML languages, or have they all been phased out?  I'm not entirely sure why I am  asking myself questions that won't be responded to, but I suppose  it's a moment to reflect upon things I thought about on the 2nd of  December on a Friday.  Yet still wanting to get out of school to enjoy the weekend, and other fun activities.  Sure, school could be fun sometimes, but for the most part I find it deadly boring.   There are not too many things that can keep my mind as active during its time spent on a fast computer.

			<p>These are my thoughts about the future of technology...</br>
			Ten years from now, I except technology not to be too far advanced from where it is now.  In our semi recessionary economy at the moment, there is less innovation and we don't' have time to think freely of new possibilities and ideas.  We are also a breaking point with being fed up with the rich.  Too many things are happening in the world to worry about advancing tech.  I do suppose that SSD drive will be the norm for higher end computers, and hard drive disks will start to phase out to the lower mid laptops.  I honestly don't expect to see too much happen.  I feel like we are an inverse derivative tangent approaching an asymptote.  Our Advance in technology is the Y value, while our time is X.  As we continue our years, we are gaining less in the tech field due to actual physical limits of silicon and computer chips.
