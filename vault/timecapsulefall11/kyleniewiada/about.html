			<h2>A <i>glimpse</i> inside...</h2>
			
			
			<p>
Significant Album:<br>
<i>Ocean Avenue</i> by <b>Yellowcard</b><br>
I simply love this 'feel good' album.  Plus, it has the song <i>Ocean Avenue</i> on it.

			<p>To comprehend a man's life, it is necessary to know not merely what he does but also what he purposely leaves undone. There is a limit to the work that can be got out of a human body or a human brain, and he is a wise man who wastes no energy on pursuits for which he is not fitted; and he is till wiser who, from among the things that he can do well, chooses and resolutely follows the best.</p>

			A significant film has always been The Matrix.  The ideas that they come up with in the first movie are quite beautiful. One of which is how reality is only how we perceive it, and we may have been wrong our whole life.  It's an interesting idea, or that how an event may not happen unless you warn the person about the opposite causes of the event.  Just like how Neo knocks the vase over in the movie, but he may not have unless he was told not to worry about knocking the vase over. (He then proceeds to look around for the vase, knocks it over, and it breaks.)

			<p class="panic">
			A significant piece of literature currently that I enjoy reading is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  It's a very humorous book poking fun of religion, and diving into many deep topics.  Like the meaning of life, and how at the end of the day, we really can't answer it.  So we just need to think about other things in our life that matter at that moment.  Because let's be honest, we're never going to answer the meaning to life.
