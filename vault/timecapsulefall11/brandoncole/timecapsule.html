			<h3>Letter To Myself</h3>
			<p>Dear Brandon in the future,</p>
			<p>So how are things going?  Hopefully you've gone through college and have a job now.  Where did you go to college?  Hope? Calvin?  University of Michigan?  Not really sure where i'm going right now.  Unless things have changed i'm guessing you Majored in computer science.  On a different note did you play for a college level soccer team?  Hopefully you made Varsity your Junior year of HS.</p>
			<p>Are you still in Michigan or did you decide to get smart and leave this bipolor state?  How about Anne Elzinga, Scott May or the Tennants?  Do you still keep in contact with any of them?  Mom and dad must be what, mid-50's now?  I hope they are still around.  On another note, did you find the one?  If so, what's her name?  Hopefully she is better than our past experiences.  My guess is you probably have had your first kid by now; if you answered yes to the previous questions.  Is it a boy or a girl?  How about pets?  Two or three; dogs or cats?</p>
			<p>Other than that I hope you still have the lively young spirit I have now.  Don't forget to take care of and love your family.  They should always be your number one priority, no matter what.  Most importantly make sure you take your kids to Disney someday!:)  Suprise the family with it as a Christmas gift or something of the sort.</p>
			<p>Kinda jumping around but how are Matthew and Brian?  (The best cousins ever!)  They should both be in college by now.  Even more important how are Ashley and Aaron?  Still speaking to them. Haha.  It's almost Christmas 2011 and the years go by quicker and quicker.  Before long i'll be watching everyone grow up around me.</p>
			<p>Don't do anything stupid and be happy.  Love,</p>
			<p>Brandon Cole</p>
