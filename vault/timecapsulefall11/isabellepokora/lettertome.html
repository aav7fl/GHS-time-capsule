					<p>Dear Self, <br> Wow, you actually opened this and are reading it. Good job! So, you made this website back in 2011 during your highschool senior year in Mr. Dolloff's Intro to Web Design class. And... I was given the very interesting task of writing a letter to my future self, you. <br> Well, you already know who I once was... But I guess I'll give you a little refresher. I was Izzy, your seventeen year old self. I was a senior in highschool at the time... and I absolutely loved music. It was your one obsession. I also loved to draw but I often found it hard to find time to do it... I was often buried with homework, but would find plenty of time to hangout with friends. Speaking of friends... I was on the robotics team. Hehehe... Those were fun times. <br>
Yeah... Robotics was one of the highlights of my highschool career. Your friends had been bugging me to join since freshmen year. You finally joined junior year and it was totally worth it. I always wondered why I hadn't joined sooner. It really helped me break out of my shell. You even became a team captain your first year! Traveling to competitions and missing out on a bunch of school was so worth it. Sitting for hours in the vehicles, listening to music, playing munchkin and falling asleep on your friends. Staying at really nice hotels and staying up all night with your friends, only to get ready early in the morning for the actual robotics competition. Countless memories right there... :v) <br> As a senior, I was still undecided on where I wanted to go to college. I applied to GVSU, MSU and U of M. All I knew was that I wanted my major to be biomedical engineering or biomedical sciences... But even that I was unsure of. As of now, I wanted to go to GVSU... But I can only plan my life so far ahead. <br> I wish I could write more to you... but you may not even be able to read this in 10 years or whatever. Oh well. I know I used to struggle with making decisions and what not, but I'm sure that I'll end up where I was meant to be. <3  <br> "A loving wish whispered in my ear, please lead with grace, all the best, my dear..." -AVA</p>
