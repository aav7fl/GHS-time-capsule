					A letter to you
				</h2>
				<p>
					Nathan 10 years ago you were planning on attending GRCC. After that you were going to attend GVSU. You were obsessively interested in videogames. Your Grandmother had just died and you received here bed and dresser to upgrade your room. You dreaded finishing your 12th grade year and really wanted to be done with high school. Every morning you would go to the library to play YUGIOH with your friends. While you were in high school you were a slacker I hope that, that changed when you attended college. Did you accomplish anything with your life? You were hoping to join a government law enforcement agency. You loved order and rules always adhering to them or creating rules where none existed. So what did you do with your life? Is it good what do you regret about your decisions?
