<h2>Significant Song, Dj Alligator � close to you</h2>
<p>
I can�t sleep at night, <br>
I�m staring at the phone<br>
Knowing you are not alone.<br>
She is right there by your side,<br>
I�m trying just to hide<br>
All the things I feel inside.<br>
<p>
I can sense the chemistry<br>
When you were standing close to me<br>
I feel like a ship<br>
That's lost at sea.<br>
It�s getting harder to ignore,<br>
It�s not like anything before,<br>
I know is crazy�baby,<br>
But I want more.<br>
<p>
I wish I could be close to you<br>
And feel your every move<br>
Never meant to feel this way,<br>
Maybe you will come around one day.<br>
<p>
I wish I could be close to you<br>
And feel your every touch<br>
Cause the sky won't heal,<br>
The way I feel, heaven knows<br>
I've wanted it so much.<br>
<p>
I wanted it so much<br>
I wanted it so much<br>
I wanted it so much<br>
(Mm ye ye)<br>
I wish that I could be<br>
So close to you�<br>
<p>
I�m the one to blame<br>
I�m trying to explain<br>
Why I would cause myself<br>
Such pain.<br>
<p>
Your heart is occupied<br>
I�ve tried to turn the time<br>
But time was never on my side.<br>
<p>
I can sense the chemistry<br>
When you're standing close to me<br>
I feel like a ship<br>
That's lost at sea.<br>
It�s getting harder to ignore,<br>
It�s not like anything before,<br>
I know is crazy�baby<br>
But I want more.<br>
<p>
I wish I could be close to you<br>
And feel your every move<br>
Never meant to feel this way,<br>
Maybe you will come around one day.<br>
<p>
I wish I could be close to you<br>
And feel your every touch<br>
Cause the sky won't heal,<br>
The way I feel, heaven knows<br>
I've wanted it so much.<br>
<p>
I want to be your every touch<br>
I want to be so close to you<br>
I want you to feel this way<br>
Feel this way<br>
Feel the way I do<br>
O ye ye ye ye<br>
O ye ye ye<br>
(I wanted it so much)<br>
Close to you<br>
Close to you<br>
Close to you<br>

<h2>Significant film, Star Trek series collection</h2>
<Font size="4"><p>The reason that I like Star Trek is because it's aventurous and many times unpredicable unless you've already seen them. During the course of all the series together they go through <i>Enterprise</i> all the way to <i>Enterprise-E</i>. The captains, and the crews, of these starships encounter other races and explore the galaxy. There are two series that don't deal with the <i>Enterprise</i>'s those being; <i>Deep Space Nine</i> which deals with a spacestation next to an active worm hole that connects the Alpha Quadrant and the Beta quadrent. The other one being <i>Voyager</i>, the ship get hurled acrossed the galaxy to the other side called the Delta quadrent and the captain sets course back towards home having to deal with numerous problems and unknown races and phenomonons</p>
<br>
Star Trek Had inspired me to create Sci-Fi stories of my own, though I try to stay away from using them for a base because their weapons for the Federation Starships are cheesy because in the first series they could already sustain their phasers without burning anything out or losing energy, they are practically unstoppable they are just too stupid to see it. Defences are more realistic so they don't have to worry about that.</font>
