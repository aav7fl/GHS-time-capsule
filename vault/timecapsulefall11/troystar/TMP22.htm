					<h3><u>Significant Film</u></h3>
						<div class="block">
						<p> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/">Pulp Fiction</a></P>
						<p>Pulp Fiction is one of my favorite movies of all time. With it's colorful characters and dialouge it's sure to catch anybody's attention. The story is about Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega, two hitmen who are out to retrieve a suitcase stolen from their employer, mob boss Marsellus Wallace. Wallace has also asked Vincent to take his wife Mia out a few days later when Wallace himself will be out of town. Along with Butch Coolidge, an aging boxer who is paid by Wallace to lose his next fight. The lives of these seemingly unrelated people are woven together comprising of a series of funny, bizarre and uncalled-for incidents.
