			<h2>
				5 popular things this year
			</h2>
			<p>
				the first and probably the most popular thing this year is the ipad.
				 it was designed by apple. apple is good at making software and make
				 things interesting but their products break very easily, so i dont really like apple because
				they just dont make quality products.
			</p>
<br>
			<p> 
				The second product is the kindle fire. it is kindle's first full color tablet that wasnt
				just for reading books with. it is seriously just a small ipad. but it wasnt made by
				apple so it actually has good hardware and probably wont break within a year of buying
				it. also my girlfriend right now isabelle pokora has one she got it for christmas so it makes
				this product pretty special to me! 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This third thing is skyrim. it is really important to me and it is probably the best game i have ever played. 
				right now in the game i have about 120 hours of gameplay into it. i play it alot! but i love every moment!
				there are dragons in the game you fight and well... the dragon fights are probably some of the most
				epic things i have ever done!! whenever a dragon starts attacking you really epic music starts
				to play and it breathes fir or frost and just... ah i really want to play it now! :D haha well yeah skyrim is awesome!
			</p>
<br>
			<p>
				this fourth thing is something that i really hate and it is flat billed hats. especially
				the ones that people leave the sticker on that comes with it when you buy it. 
				leaving the stick on after buying it is like buying clothes and leaving all the obvious tags on them!
				its just stupid and no one should do it!!! grr. haha yeah i really dont like them.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				the 5th and last thing are 3d tvs. they arent super popular right now because the tvs are really expensive and then you
				also need to buy really expensive glasses that you have to wear at all times while watching anything in 3d. those two 
				reasons have stopped 3d tvs from really taking off. they have been gaining popularity just not as fast as the producers had hoped.	
				It seems evrything is trying to be in 3d now. even theater movies.
