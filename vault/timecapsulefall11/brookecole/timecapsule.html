				<h2>happiness</h2>
				Happiness to me is waking up in the morning and loving your life, your friends, & family, having no regrets, and not letting anything or anyone get in the way of your dreams.
				<br>
				<h2>freedom</h2>
				To me free is more then being able to do whatever you want, whenever you want.
				its having the right to be on your own and not relying on anyone anymore.
				its living your life the way you want!

				<h2>prediction of technology</h2>
				well techonology is getting very fancy. they are coming out with home 3D TV's(by this time thats prolly all you can have} and im sure all cell phones are smart phones and touch screen. cars have prolly made a GIANT step in technology,they prolly dont run on fuel anymore and have a lot more safty things with them.
