 <h2>Technological Predictions - 10 Years from Now - Top 3<span class="postmeta">By: Skylar Pagniello</span> </h2>
  <p><b class="drop-f"><span>F</span></b>irst, I would love if instead of video game controllers it was just a room where you could do all sorts of actions in the games.  Second, waterproof smartphones would be really nice because smartphones are not cheap and need to be more durable.  The third thing I would want in the future would be touch projections from phones or computers. </p>

     <h2>Significant Book<span class="postmeta">By: Skylar Pagniello	</span> </h2>
     <p><b class="drop-i"><span>i</span></b>n the year 2007 (5 years ago) the Harry Potter series was finished by J. K. Rowling.  The final book was called Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows.  It was the seventh book in the awesome series.  The movie for The Deathly Hallows was released in 2011 (last year).  It took two movies to cover all the action and left everybody in suspense. </p>

 <h2>Significant Film<span class="postmeta">By: Skylar Pagniello</span> </h2>
  <p><b class="drop-a"><span>a</span></b>vatar is my favorite movie from the last 5 years.  It's a movie about humans on an alien planet trying to get a rare, expensive metal.  Avatar turns into the best love story thats not super chick like.  It turns out that they transfer the humans into their Avatars and they live happily ever after. </p>

 <h2>Significant Song<span class="postmeta">By: Skylar Pagniello</span> </h2>
  <p><b class="drop-m"><span>m</span></b>y favorite song that I heard yesterday (5/10/12) and is now my favorite song is "The Churn of the Century - By: Bassnectar."  It's a dubstep song that starts out like an old-timey record song with trumpets and turns into a dubstep beat down.  Then in the middle of the song it combines both sounds to bring the old and new generation of music together.  Just when you think it's over it's not.</p>
