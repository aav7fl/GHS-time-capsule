 <h2>My Definition of Happiness
 <span class="postmeta">By:  Skylar Pagniello</span>
 </h2>
  <p><b class="drop-h"><span>H</span></b>appiness to me is looking past the flaws in your life and see that people care about you. When you learn that spending time with them is the best feeling. Happiness is contagious. If you make people happy they will make you happy. </p>

     <h2>My Definition of Freedom <span class="postmeta">By: Skylar Pagniello</span> </h2>
     <p><b class="drop-f"><span>F</span></b>reedom is what life is all about.  Without Freedom people try to kill themselves.  I'm not the best person at being free.  I like people that I'm comfortable with.  I hate being confined to a small place.  Freedom is not being in the dark; knowing the problems.</p><p><br />"Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed."
 - <u>Martin Luther King Jr.</u></p>
