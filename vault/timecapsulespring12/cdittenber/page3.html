<h4>	          To my future self,

I hope that time has been kind to you, and that you are well.
You wrote this letter some time ago and gave it to someone you trust in the hopes it would never be needed.
I can't predict what your life is like, but it's likely that some of the things you may be facing are things you went through with your own parents and others. It's because of that that you wrote yourself this letter.
<p>I think that technology 10 years from now will be even greater. All cars will be run by electricity, computers will be faster and easier to use, and the way that we communicate with each other will be way past our regular texting and calling today.
To me I believe that the bible is the most significant piece of literature</p></h4>
