				Dear Hánnah,
<p>
By the time you get this, this letter will already be ten years old. I bet a lot of things have changes since you were 19. Like the cell phones probably rutned to holographic images
and kids probably have computers or something of that kind to work off instead of writing things by hand like I did when I went to school. Your life has probably changed drastically too.
I bet you have a career as a translator for the deaf in the courts. By now, you probably have a family or are going to start one soon with a special guy or that guy you dated in high school.
In case you don't remember what his name was, it's Mitch VanLoenen. He was a great guy and took really good care of you whenever you needed something, he was there for you. 
Even though you gave him crap about practically everything.I hope that has changed in you at least. Writing this letter to you, aka myself, is kinda weird, cause it is for me. 
I can't really think ten years into the future. Well, I have nothing really to say, except, good luck and relive the glory days through this virtual time capsule, I hope things go well for
you in the future. Have a great life!
</p> <p>
Ps. If you ever have a doughter, remember to name her Macy Faye, because that was the name of your great grandmother. And make sure you have the middle name robert for your first son, after Grandpa Dibble.
Trust me, you won't regret it later :)
</p>
Sincerely, Hánnah (age 19) 	 </div>
