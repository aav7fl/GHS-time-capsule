		       <h2>Letter To My Future Self</h2>
		 Hey Ben,<br><br>
		 I hope things are going well for you. Did you get your degree in physics, or did you decide to change majors? Are you done with school, or still pursuing some advanced studies? I hope you have good friends and people in your life, and I hope you are financially stable as well! I am just about to finsih my senior year of high school. In the last two weeks I have completed some inmporant goals - I decided to attend Michigan State University, applied for my Eagle Scout award, competed in my last Science Olympiad tournament! (We took 5th in the state, and I was a state champion one last time with a gold medal in Optics!) My last day of school is May 22nd, and even after a great senior year, I am beyond excited to finally be done with high school. Well, I will see you in, oh, about 10 years.<br><Br>

My sincerest regards,<br>
Ben Brophy

				<br>
				Freedom is the ability to pursue activities which bring you joy. It can be attained by living in a country which does not restrict your human rights, earning money to pay for expensive opportunities, and not over-committing one's self to work one is not interested in.
