					<h4><p> Hey, in 2012 you were in 11th grade and it wasn't your best year for school. You let yourself go with working at Menards.
					Our first car was a 1999 Pontiac Bonneville and you call her Bonnie. But we still had a good time, even though we worked a lot. 
					You've been dating Taylor Shank for two and a half years and kept the same friends but also
					gained new ones. At the moment your not sure what you want to be yet. Your thinking about being a teacher, but also going into
					the Military or Army.</h4>

								 <h3>Happiness:</h3>
								 To me happiness is doing what is making me happy and at the moment what makes me happy is hanging out with my friends and 
								 my girlfriend "Taylor Shank".

								 <h3>Freedom:</h3>
								My thoughts on freedom is that I should have my own responsibilities and being able to make your own choices that you think will benefit you the most.
