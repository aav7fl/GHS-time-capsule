						 <h3>Technology In 2022:</h3>																																																						
					In 2022 technology will take a massive change. The cars will all run off of solar powered roads,
					instead of batteries there will be chips that are solar powered. The are will have robots that have the 
					capability to do whatever they are told. Also movies and T.V. will all be played in 4D. For cell phones 
					they will all be smartphones and some of the better ones will be holograms. Finally computers will be so small that
					they will be the size of a watch, and wifi areas won't be needed because satillites will send down wifi
					to everybody.
					<hr> 
			<h3>Top Movies:</h3>
					I love many movies, mostly funny movies too. The movies I like the most were any movie with Will Ferrel.

					 <h3>Lack Of Literature:</h3>
					 All throughout my life I hated reading. I never got into it, but the only thing I would ever read would 
					 be Sports Illistrated.
