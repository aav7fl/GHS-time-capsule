	         <p>Right now as you are reading this I will have been out of high school for 10 years now and things like technology and culture will have changed alot.  So since the technology has changed, I'm apologizing for the quality of this time capsule in advance.  Next to this is a paragragh is a menu of things that I have put together so you can see how things have changed since I was in high school last, so enjoy and don't laugh to hard.  Happiness and freedom too me ten years ago would have been going up North in Michigan and being outdoors. </p>
