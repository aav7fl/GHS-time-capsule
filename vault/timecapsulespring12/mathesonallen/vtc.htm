	     Hello, future self. You probably have no memory of doing this project.
			  Although I doubt that you will ever see this, you did this during your senior year of High School. 
				This was when you played League of Legends and you had the crew. 
				I don't think that much will have changed since you wrote this(as far as technology), I expect Youtube to be gone along with Facebook.
				If you are still the same person, you will not have tried alcohol or drugs yet.
				<p>
				At this point in your life, happiness was an easy thing to come by. 
				Sitting at home alone or hanging out with the crew was an ideal day and that was what made you happy.
				<p>
				You thought that freedom was having the ability to go out where you wanted, when you wanted.
				By the time you read this again, America probably has changed for the worse, seeing that we are becoming more socialist everyday.
				You probably will not be able to easily get privacy and your rights might be restricted.
				<p>
				I assume that technology will be more advanced, but I don't think it will be too different. 
				I could see things being faster/easier to use but nothing revolutionary or something that will replace computers(as far as hardware).
