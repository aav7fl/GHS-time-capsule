						<center><br><font size="3.5">2012 had a lot of pop culture items/events. Popular shoes were Toms. Victoria's Secret Backpacks were huge at Grandville High School. People thought the world was going to end on December 21 due to the Myan calendar ending on that date. One Direction was the popular boy band at the time, loved by everyone except me. The Hipster style was huge at the time, throwing together fake glasses, floral jeans, and shirts that don't make any sense. I honestly have no idea why this style is so popular.  </font> </center>
