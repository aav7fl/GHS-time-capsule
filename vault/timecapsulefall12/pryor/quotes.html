							"This life is what you make it. Not matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes, it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And babe, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soul mate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about." 
 <p>-Marilyn Monroe

					<br> <font size="3">  "The glow that the sun gets right around sunset
Helps me realize
This is just a journey
Drop your worries

You are gonna turn out fine
Oh, turn out fine
Fine... oh, you turn out fine
But you gotta keep your head up
And you can let your hair down
But you gotta keep your head up
And you can let your hair down

I know it's hard (know it's hard)
To remember sometimes
But you gotta keep your head up
And you can let your hair down." <p>Keep Your Head Up- Andy Grammer
