<p>I hope life is treating you well. As of right now, I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I hope you find the perfect career and are happy with the choices you�ve made. I hope you talk to mom and dad a lot. They are the only things I have right now and I hope you remember that as you get older. I hope you have a place now and are able to get all the pets you could want. I hope you�re taking care of yourself and your diabetes is going alright. 
<p>Even if things are tough right now, you'll get through them. I promise. You've made it this far and have kept going. Don't let life bring you down. You can always ask mom and dad for help and you'll have friends that will stand behind you.
