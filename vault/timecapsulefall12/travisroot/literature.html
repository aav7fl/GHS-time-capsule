<b>Some Significant Quotes</b>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>"My precious."</t>
<t>"I see dead people."</t>
<t>"I'm the king of the world!"</t>
<t>"You had me at 'hello.'"</t>
<br/>
<br/>

<b>Some Significant Music</b>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>At the moment, I am a huge fan of the British bands Coldplay and Muse, as well as the American band The Killers.</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>However, I also listen to electronic music such as Deadmau5, Porter Robinson, etc, and enjoy producing it as well. Since 2011 I’ve been using my dad’s copy of Cakewalk Sonar 6.</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>But all this you remember, of course.</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>At this point, my favorite song is “Knights of Cydonia” by Muse, tied with “Maths” by Deadmau5. Completely different, both wonderful.</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>



<b>A Significant Piece of Literature</b>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>At this point, my favorite book remains a tie between “The Things They Carried” by Tim O’Brien and “Redwall” by Brian Jaques. I really don’t read much, though.</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>A Significant Movie</b>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>At this date in 2012, Avatar is the the highest-grossing movie of all time. Chris Nolan’s Batman series, however, is more highly regarded by popular culture, as well as his other movies such as Inception.</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>The 2004 film Mean Girls has recently resurged as a pop culture reference. And finally, tomorrow I am seeing The Hobbit, a movie that is predicted to make loads of money.</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>Time will tell.</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>(Okay, the weekend has passed, and I thoroughly enjoyed the Hobbit. And yes, it has already made loads of money.)</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<b>5 Pop Culture Icons</b>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>I have no clue what to put down here. Pop culture sucks.
<br/>
<br/>
<t>But for kicks and giggles: Justin Beiber, Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Selina Gomez. I know that isn't five, but at this point, I won't think of any other notable teenybopper idols.
