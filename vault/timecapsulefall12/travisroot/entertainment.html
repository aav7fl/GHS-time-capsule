<b>Dear Travis Root of the future!</b>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>Congratulations on surviving the 2012 Mayan Apocalypse. I knew we could count on you!</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>In addition, I hope you’re thoroughly enjoying the wonders of the future (hoverboards, teleportation, the newest iPhone, etc). If not, stop reading and go enjoy them.</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>If I had any idea what you do for a living, I’d comment on that. But at the moment (your senior year of highschool, 2012) I haven’t the slightest.</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>Glad you figured things out, though!</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>And if not, well, I know the feeling.</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>By the way, in case I’m able to perceive my thoughts in the future while reading this over (by some manner of telepathic link), please take this time to warn me of anything you want me to change in the past. Keeping in mind that I’m/you’re seventeen.</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>Hey, by the way, I’m listening to Phantom pt. 1 by Justice right now. Remember them?</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>I do wonder what kind of music you listen to/produce nowadays. And what with.</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>But please tell me the pop-house thing has died by now.</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>Do you remember snap-chat? I do. It’s stupid. But I do enjoy setting up awesome pics on Lindsay’s snap-chat occasionally, just to confuse and impress her friends.</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>Please tell me you still talk to her.</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>Anyway, let’s see... anything else I might want to talk about... hmm...</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>I’ll talk about AV right now. Why not?</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>Right now, I’m antsy with anticipation for third hour, in which I get to continue editing my two big videos: a stereotype-style movie trailer about a fictional film about life giving a girl lemons, and a multi-part large-scale documentary about the social life behind theater productions. Both are coming along nicely. Time will tell if they ever get the recognition my Gangnam Style video got. I kinda doubt it.</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>Starting to listen to Muse now (don’t know if they’re the next Coldplay though...). Kenzie Quinn says she’ll give me her CD’s to burn, which I figure must be a good thing. Better than paying for them, that’s for sure.</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>I have an orchestra concert tonight. Or rather, I have a choir concert for which I’m playing Hallelujah Chorus. Should be fun...</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>Anyway, enough about me!</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>How’s the future? I certainly hope you’ve done some fun things since the writing of this letter (December 13 2012) and expect a letter back within the coming weeks. But knowing my/your procrastinating tendencies, perhaps I expect too much.</t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>Anyway, that’s about it from me. </t>
<br/>
<br/>
<t>There are other items included on this assignment as well, such as some significant quotes/movies/music from the past. I certainly hope all this jogs your/my memory.</t>

<br/>
<br/>

<t>PS: the date has changed and a piece of history has fallen into place.  It is now the 17th, and this past weekend will be remembered as the setting of the second-largest school shooting in U.S. history. Earlier this hour, we had a moment of silence for the victims in Connecticut.</t>
