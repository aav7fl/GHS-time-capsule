<h3>Bruises- Train</h3>I think it is important to remember that everyone has struggles and bruises in life.</li> 
<h3>22- Taylor Swift</h3>I just think this is a really fun song. Its just about being young and forgetting your worries.</li>
<h3>10000 Reasons- Matt Redman</h3>This is the first song I heard at the new church I recently became apart of! </li>
<h3>Need you now- Plumb</h3>When i hear this song, I think about giving everything to God and pray for him to help me through life.</li>

True Friends is a poem that I found years ago. I loved it so much. I love my best friend Cierra. She is like my sister, understand eachother and help eachother with whatever problems we may have. <br>

I thought Letters to God was an excellent movie and had a really good point of God and Heaven to get through to people of all ages. People that may be struggling with their faith need direction, thats exactly what this movie does.
