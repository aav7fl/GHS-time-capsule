		      <h3> Happiness is feeling great, independent, and free. Finding great friends, having fantastic role models, and pushing yourself to be the best you can be. Going forward to fulfill your dreams, and realizing you can reach them. Waking up in the morning and saying to yourself, "it is a beautiful day" and before you know it you will look back and say, "Wow, that was a beautiful life." </h3>

		 <center>   <h3> Heyy, Remember me!?! Hope so. If you're reading this then you have graduated from high school and got out of college not too long ago with your teaching degree. Now life has begun. Hopefully you are married to a great guy, hopefully the one you dated through the beginning of your senior year. I always loved him. I hope you have kids or are trying to have some. Hopefully the little girl and boy you want. I hope you have stayed in touch with Cierra and her family. I could never see you leaving Christ Lutheran, especially how the church family is amazing. Keep your faith. It's really important, but you learned that at an early age. Hopefully you have found a job teaching those cute little kindergarteners. I hope you, and the VanWieren family have all kept in touch, I hope you have made a bigger impact in Anna's life than you would have ever imagined. I hope you are still active and do as many sports as you have time for. I hope Mom and Dad are still doing well and that you are active in their lives. I hope everything is working out and you're not struggling. But your strong, you can get through whatever you need to.</h3> </center>

		  <h3>Freedom to me, is not having a care in the world. Not having to stress out about everything and try to fix everything that might go wrong. Freedom is like when your parents let you go out and give you more space because they haven't realized you were a good kid until your senior year in high school. Freedom is when people give you more responsibility because they realize how great of a person you are.</h3>
