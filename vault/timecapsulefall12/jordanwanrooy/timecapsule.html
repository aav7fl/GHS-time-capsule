		  Dear Jordan, <p>
					 It's currently December 2012 and we're 17. I don't know if/when you'll be reading this but hopefully everything's going well in the future. 
					 It's our senior year and we'll be graduating in May. I don't know which college we're going to yet but I know we'll make a good choice and I hope you had lots of fun.
					 One of the worst single-person school shootings happened this past Friday in Conneticut. Hopefully, there isn't too much of that going on in the future. 
					 But maybe they'll have some new groundbreaking technology in the future but who knows... I guess you do. I saw The Hobbit this weekend, loved it. I hope we still share
					 a love for Middle Earth and the other one or two parts are just as good/better. Is Saturday Night Live still on? They must have a million seasons by now, they're already on their 38th. They better 
					 still be funny. I wonder what direction music is headed in. There've been some dramatic changes over the past few decades. Do you rememeber the type of music you used to listen
					 to? Dubstep has grown a lot the past couple years. You used to like it quite a bit, maybe you still do. That and indie/alternative. Quite the hipster. 
					 Well this is just an introduction for my time capsule website. It'll be interesting to see where life takes us. <br>
					 					 				Until I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together, <p>
																		Jordan
