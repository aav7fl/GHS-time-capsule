	        My definition of happiness: The point of being completely relaxed, not worried about tomorrow, about the future. Being able to say you're finally just all around satisfied with yourself, and the people around you. When you can walk the world without a care of what someone thinks.
<br><br> <p>My definition of freedom: Being able to think, feel, and do what you want, while being treated equally.
<br><br> Significant Song Lyrics Of Mine:<br> It's no surprise, I won't be here tomorrow<br>
I can't believe that I stayed till today<br>
Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow<br>
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise<br>
It came out like a river once I let it out<br>
When I thought that I wouldn't know how<br>
Held onto it forever just pushing it down<br>
Felt so good to let go of it now<br>
Not wrapping this in ribbons<br>
Shouldn't have to give a reason why.<br>
