	        *Letter to myself (10 years from now*<br>
	<p>Hello, I'm Haylee from the past. If you're reading this as Haylee from the present, than you've probably already graduated high school. Hopefully you're enrolling into college. Majoring in something to do with psychology. I don't know who you're dating, but if you're dating someone I hope they're treating you good. You deserve it. You've been through a lot. As a high schooler, you were a pretty smart kid, and a loyal friend. I hope you've stuck with some of the friends you made throughout high school. If not, then that's fine too. I just hope you've found some new ones. I hope upon reading this you've had a little flash back of sophomore year. I'm glad to say it so far its been a pretty good year. Good luck to you as you go on in life. (I hope you've crossed the vanilla mayo jar off your bucket list ) 
<p>Bucket List #1: Empty out majo jar. Fill with vanilla pudding. Eat in public. <br>
<p>Bucket List #2: Steal a Christamas Tree.<br>
<p>Bucket List #3: Rescue a dog from the human society.<br>
Significant Movie: The Notebook
