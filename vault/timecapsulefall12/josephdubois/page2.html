   <br><p>Freedom to me is being able to worship without threat of persecution</p>
	 <br><p>Freedom to me is the ability to run anywhere</p>
	 <br><p>Freedom to me is being able to make my own decisions</p>
	 <br><p>Freedom to me is living without someone or something controlling my every move</p>

		       <h3>My Prediction of the Future</h3>
	          <p>If you don't remember I'll take the liberty of reminding you of the 
						conversations with your dad regarding the end times though I doubt 
						that if you are reading this than the, "armies of the east" haven't 
						attacked yet.</p><br><p>So if it is not the end time's than you're probably 
						okay for a little bit. However the world of your day is undoubtedly 
						different from when you wrote this prediction. You predicted that in 
						your day there will be some political strife but that goes without 
						saying.</p><br> <p>You should have a job by now and be reasonably successful. 
						You predicted that there would be jetpacks in your time. You 
						predicted that the next radical form of technology would be invented 
						(hopefully by you) and you predicted that dad would come up with a 
						weird new Christmas tradition.</p><br><p>I also predict that Emilee is 
						married by now as is Dan and that Becki and Katie have children by 
						now.</p><br><p>I predict that the Hobbit movies were awesome and so 
						was Avengers 2, and the Star wars 7,8,&,9 were awesome.</p><br><p>
						Whatever happens though you will be find and one prediction that is 
						correct is that god will always be with you.</p>		 
						
						<br><h3>My Definition of Happiness</h3>
	<p>Happiness to me is spending time my family and a good story whether it be a book or movie.</p> 
	<br><p>Happiness to me is getting a passing grade on an APUSH test.</p> 
	<br><p>Happiness to me is schooling my cousins in X-box and paint ball.</p> 
	<br><p>Happiness to me at this time is every minute of every day that I am alive in Gods earth.</p>
