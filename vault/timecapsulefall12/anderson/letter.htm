<h2>I am 16 and currently a junior at Grandville High School in the year 2012. In 10 years I will be 26 years old (weird!), but between now and then I have some goals. I
want to be graduated from college with a degree in something that I enjoy. (Probably psychology?) I also would like to be married by then and have a couple of kids at
least. Maybe I'll be living out of state (or even out of country!) or maybe I'll still be in Michigan. At this point my future seems really up in the air, and hopefully
I'll have more of my life figured out by 26! I'll leave that in God's hands though. In 10 years I want to have a better relationship with God and people around me. I 
want to make sure that I never forget the importance of family in my life and never forget what I stand for and my values. I won't change for anyone and lower my 
standards because I know what I deserve and who I am in Christ. I want to make a positive influence on the people I'm around and in the world in general..
