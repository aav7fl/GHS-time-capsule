<h3>There have been ups and downs to 2012, but there have definitely been some big things happening in pop culture. From movies, books, people, and styles, these are the
things that shaped 2012.</h3>

One of the most popular songs of 2012 was Gangnam Style by PSY. The video on youtube has almost 1 billion views!

One Direction was also a pretty big band this year. I don't particularly like them, but a lot of people do.
