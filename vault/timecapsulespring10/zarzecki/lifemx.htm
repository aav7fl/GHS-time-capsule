							<center><h4>Our whole street rides dirt bikes. I used to go watch everyone ride across our street ride. My dad got me my 
							 first bike for my 12th birthday. It was a 2003 Honda XR80R. I rode the day lights out of that thing. I only rode trails at that time.
							 Then when I became to big for that bike my dad traded in my bike for a 2004 Honda CR85R. This was my first race bike. I continued to ride trails
							 at that time until I began to ride with Dakotah Norton. His dad took Dakotah and I to some of the tracks Dakotah raced at. I instantly loved
							 riding motocross tracks. Then when I had my huge growth spirt, my dad traded in my bike for a 2005 CR125R and this is the bike I have been riding ever since.
							 I am continuing to get faster and more serious about my time on my bike.

							 <center><h4>The gear I wear while I am riding includes a HJC helmet, Oakley Tribal O-frame goggles, Fox chest protector, EVS
							 RC2 race collar, Thor Core vented pants and jersey, Fox Camplosion gloves, Fox Knee and Shin guards, and Alpinestar Tech 6 boots.</h5>

							 <center><h4>My main race bike is my 2005 Honda CR125R. It is a two-stroke liquid cooled motocross bike. Some of the mods it has on it include a complete 
							 Pro-Cicuit race exhaust system, Cycra Stealth DX Handguards, Protaper oversized handlebar and clamps, JD Jetting Kit, Red Anodized
							 Renthal Sprockets, Factory Effex and Shawmut Hills graphics kit, custom suspension valving, and Michelin S12XC tires. This bike runs on Sunoco 110
							 octane race gas mixed with Maxima Castor 927.</h5></center>

							 <br>
							 <center><h4>My other bike is a 2004 Kawasaki KLX110 Pit Bike. This is the probably my favortie thing to ride. I bought this last year
							 and modded it out to look like my big bike. Some of the mods it has on it include red UFO plastic, Honda Graphics, BBR +1.5" dampening rods,
							 Two Brothers Stiff Springs, Custom made I-shock rear shock with piggy back resivour, Yoshimura RS2 Carbon Race Exhaust, BBR U-Flow air filter, 
							 Custom Jetting, BBR Tall Seat, and Pro Taper XR50 bars. This bike must run on Premium gas or a 50/50 mix of 110 race fuel and premium. </h5>

							 <center><h4>When I am not at the race track I sometimes ride on my outdoor track at my house. This track has no mna made jumps, but is
							 pretty much laid out like an enduro track consisting of natural jumps, sand corners and many braking bumps. However, I do not ride at this 
							 track very much due to the fact it gets boring fast and my bike is said to be too loud for our neighbors. I also have a pitbike track that resembles and outdoor motocross track.
							 I ride my pit bike here and train on my pit bike when I am no at the race track because my pit bike isnt too loud. This track has some small 8ft doubles and 
							 3 foot whoops, also goes in and out of the woods. It has one big 18ft double that is very fun to hit but you have to hit it just right or you will
							 run the risk of over clearing the landing.</h5></center>

							 <center><h4>So far I have not sustained any serious injuries that run a huge risk to my health. So far the only injuries I have recieved
							 have been cracked knee caps which lead to Bursa Sack infections, hyper extended back and neck, jammed fingers, many sprains, and separated shoulder.</h5></center>

							 <center><h4>My riding schedule is pretty normal. My dad takes me to the track every Wednesday and Sunday that we can. On those days we either 
							 practice at Big Air MX, Martin Xtreme Racing, or Victory Lane MX. On Sundays I train with ex-pro Adam Martin who owns Martin Xtreme Racing.
							 While at the track I usually do my warm up of stretches and a quick 5 minute moto to check out the track. From then on I either do two 30 min motos or four 10 minute sprints.
							 Sprints are when you go as fast as possible without stopping to build stamina. When I used to train/ride with Dakotah Norton and his dad, his dad would throw rocks at us to get us to go faster.
							 I do not eat junk food or fast food anymore due to the fact it makes me laggy and creates fat.</h5></center>

							 <center><h4>Motocross is cool because it is the ultimate unity of man and machine. It is probably the most physically demanding sport other than
							 soccer. We ride in rain, snow, hail, deathly hot conditions and there are no substitues in motocross. Our races dont stop for rain or mud.
							 Our season doesn't end due to winter it continues all year long. Also it is a family sport. Motocross is good clean fun that the whole family can enjoy together. However, my mom does not like
							 to watch me ride as she cringes everytime I hit huge jumps. But, she rides my pitbike around with no problems and loves every minute of it. My dad, mom, and I all go riding sometimes down to our neighbors track and have a good time together.</h5></center>
