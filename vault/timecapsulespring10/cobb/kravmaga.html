<h1>About:</h1>

The name in Hebrew means "Hand-to-hand combat." Krav (&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;) meaning "combat" and Maga (&#1502;&#1490;&#1506;) meaning "contact" or "touch". So basically, "Combat on Contact", which means that you're in physical combat (hand-to-hand), not shooting bullets at each other from a distance.

<b>Krav Maga's origins were developed by a Jewish Czech, Imi Lichtenfeld,

 in the late 1930's to protect his community against anti-Semitic violence</b>
<p>
<img src="imi.jpg" width="200" depth="500">
<img src="kravmaga3.jpg" width="300" depth="600">
<p>
Imi designed Krav Maga for people of all shapes, sizes, and physical abilities regardless of age. While Krav Maga was designed to teach soldiers 
to become proficient in hand-to-hand combat tactics in a short time, the same is true of Krav Maga's civilian adaptation. Krav Maga is well 
received within law enforcement and military circles. Numerous law enforcement agencies and military branches all over the world train their men 
and women in Krav Maga.



<p>
Krav Maga, of course, steps up to the plate when it comes to weapons defense more than any other system out there.  They have a thorough 
understanding of how attacks happen and the natural responses of the attacker.<p>
<img src="kravmaga1.jpg" width="200" depth="500">
<p>

Krav Maga is an eclectic self-defense and military hand-to-hand combat system developed in Israel, which assumes no quarter will be given, 
and emphasizes maximum threat neutralization in a "real life" context. It came to prominence following its adoption by various Israeli Security 
Forces.<p>

<p><img src="km5.jpg" width="250" depth="550"><p>

In Krav Maga, there are no hard-and-fast rules, and no distinction in training for men and women. It is not a sport, and there are no specific
 uniforms, attire or competitions, although some organizations recognize progress through training with rank badges and different levels. All 
 the techniques focus on maximum efficiency in real-life conditions. Krav Maga generally assumes that the individual attacking will give no 
 quarter; therefore, as a response the attacks and defenses are intended only for use in potentially lethal threat situations with the aim to 
 neutralize and escape as rapidly and safely as possible. Crippling attacks to vulnerable body parts, including groin and eye strikes, headbutts, 
 and other efficient and potentially brutal attacks, improvised use of any objects available, and maximizing personal safety in a fight, are 
 emphasized. However, it must be stressed that instructors can and do demonstrate how to moderate the techniques to fit the circumstances. While 
 no limits are placed on techniques to be used in life-threatening situations, the legal need to inflict the appropriate minimal damage in other 
 circumstances is recognized and stressed.
 
 
<img src="km11.jpg" width="600" depth="800">

<p><b>--The guiding principles for those performing Krav Maga techniques are:</b>

     <br>* Do not get hurt
     <br>* Neutralize your attacker as fast as possible
     <br>* Go from defending to attacking as quickly as possible
     <br>* Use the body's natural reflexes
     <br>* Strike at any vulnerable point
     <br>* Use any tool or object available to you
<p>
<b>--According to a description written for the self-publication media site Associated Content, the basic premises of Krav Maga are:</b>

     <br>* You're not going to care how much damage you're going to cause.
     <br>* Cause as much damage as possible and run.
     <br>* Do not try to prolong a fight. Do what needs to be done and escape.


<p><img src="km4.jpg" width="200" depth="500">


<p>Again, this must be read in the context of a life-threatening situation. Instructors will constantly stress the need, in less extreme 
circumstances, to match the response to the danger or risk.

The basic idea is to deal first with the immediate threat (being choked, for example), prevent the attacker from re-attacking, and then 
neutralize the attacker, proceeding through all steps in a methodical manner, despite the rush of adrenaline that occurs in such an attack. 
The emphasis is put on taking the initiative from the attacker as soon as possible. Indeed, some circumstances may require pre-emptive action, 
which may or may not be violent. Options here could range from "get your retaliation in first" to situational awareness (also part of the 
training) that might avoid a dangerous situation developing.

<p>

<b>--Some of the fighting (like practice, or competitions) rules of Krav Maga are:</b>
    <br>* Counter attacking as soon as possible (or attacking preemptively).
    <br>* Targeting attacks to the body's most vulnerable points such as the eyes, jaw, throat, groin, knee etc.
    <br>* Neutralizing the opponent as quickly as possible by responding with an unbroken stream of counter attacks and if necessary a take 
		down/joint break.
    <br>* Maintaining awareness of surroundings while dealing with the threat in order to look for escape routes, further attackers, objects 
		that could be used to defend or help attack and so on.<p>

<h3>Beware of Fake Krav Maga Offshoots!!!</h3>

<i>A range of copy cat systems have emerged internationally. Each one hoping to capitalise on the success of Krav Maga. Krav Maga has developed 
such a good reputation that many off shoots are marketed soley on their association with, or criticisms of Krav Maga.
<p>
Probably the most notorious copy cat system is <strong>Commando Krav Maga</strong>. Founded by Judo Instructor Moni Aizik, Aizik has become 
infamous for his numerous claims and war stories.
<p>
<strong>C.K.M</strong> became notorious after Aizik made a range of implausible claims about co-founding the Krav Maga system. Embarassingly, it 
later emerged that Aizik had no Krav Maga certification or teaching experience and was not the 'Special Forces' Commando he claimed to be. 
Further revelations emerged. So much so, that we dedicated a whole page to the antics of this individual. See Commando Krav Maga Sucks Among his 
less well thought out claims was that Aizik co-founded Krav Maga with IMI. Unfortunatly Aizik had not realised that to have revamped the IDF 
hand to hand system as claimed, he would have only been 9 or 10 years old at the most ;-) A great story though. Needless to say, Aiziks various 
claims are ridiculed by the Krav Maga Organisations, the IDF and the Counter Terror trainers. </i>
