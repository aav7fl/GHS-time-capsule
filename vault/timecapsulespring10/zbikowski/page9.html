Tom went to Grenbrier Elementary school and Thomas middle school in Arlington Heights Illinois. Zbikowski played at Notre Dame as a freshman and started as a sophomore. He was named an honorable mention All-American at the conclusion of the 2007 regular season after being named honorable mention All-American as a punt returner in 2006. Tom Zbikowski was invited to the 2008 NFL scouting combine and worked out with the Defensive Backs. He measured in at 5 feet 11 inches and weighed in at 215 pounds. He impressed scouts and helped his draft stock by showing his athleticism including running what was then reported to be a 4.55 forty yard dash. It was later revealed that his time had been misreported and he actually ran a 4.44[1]. He also had a 32.5 inch vertical, a 10 feet 2 inch broad jump and pounded out 24 reps with 225 lbs on the bench press. He was rated the best overall strong safety (SS) by ESPN's Mel Kiper, Jr. and NFLdraftscout.com.Zbikowski was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the third round (86th overall) of the 2008 NFL Draft. In his rookie year, Zbikowski played in all 16 games and had 19 tackles. His first career start was Monday night 12-7-09 he recorded 4 tackles and an interception.On June 10, 2006, Zbikowski made his professional boxing debut at Madison Square Garden in New York City, beating his opponent, Robert Bell of Akron, Ohio, by TKO within 49 seconds of the first round. The fight was compliant with NCAA guidelines.[citation needed] Bell, who is an Ohio State fan, wore an Ohio State football jersey into the ring. He signed a three fight contract and has one fight left. Zbikowski's second fight was against Ryan St. Germaine on March 6, 2007 at the Century Center in South Bend, Indiana. After the 2008 NFL season he decided to put his boxing career on hold to focus on football.
