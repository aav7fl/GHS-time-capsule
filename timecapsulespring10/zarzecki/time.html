		 <p>After highschool I plan on going straight into college. I will be attending GVSU in Allendale for my Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering. 
		 During the summer after completeing my sophomore year at GVSU, I will be living in Ohio for the summer to take part in a summer CO-OP/Internship at the 
		 Honda Motorcycle R&D department. After recieving my bachlors degree I will be going to Arizona for a year to recieve my certification in Motorcycle Mechanics at MMI. After completing all this 
		 I hope to be picked up by a factory racing team to work as a factory mechanic or an R&D guy for the team.

								 <p><h5>The Leatt GPX Club neck brace system is one of my items for many reasons. The Leatt brace has been proven to save lives and 
								 prevent severe neck and spinal injuries. The brace is becoming one of the must haves for riding motocross these days due to people going faster and 
								 jumping higher and bigger jumps. I wear one so I dont become a vegetable in the rare case of a severe crash.They are wore by many pros and amatuers today and they just came out two years ago. They are expensive ranging from the Adventure at $285 to the 
								 Club which is $395. However, what would you rather do, spend money on something that will save your life or be a vegetable?</h5></p>

								 <br>
								 <p><h5>The 2010 CRF450R made by Honda is in my time capsule becuase it is the definition of the latest and greatest in motocross technology.
								 The 2010 CRF450R has an electronical fuel injection system on it instead of a mechanical one. The 450 comes with a little computer which allows you to tune
								 the jetting of the bike depending on conditions of the track and weather. This bike can also hook directly into a computer via USB allowing you to tune the jetting and motor
								 characteristics from there. This computerisation has eliminated the need for changing out jets or fussing with the air/fuel mixture screw. This bike has won many awards for its inovative design.
								 Plus the bike just flat out RIPS!!!!
		 						 <br>

								 <br>
								 <p><h5>The 2010 KTM SX150 is in my time capsule because it is one of the few surviving two-stroke race bikes in a class dominated by four-strokes.
								 The bike is a liquid cooled 150cc engine that hangs with any four-stroke power plant. The bike has power everywhere and the throttle response is crisp all around.
								 This bike is keeping the pre-mix junkies happy and the two stroke supporters confident while racing the four stroke bikes.

								 <br>
								 <p><h5>The GM bankruptcy I leave in here becuase it is a symbol of how unpatriotic and unsupportive the United States had become.
								 People decidied to not support American industry and unions and the outcome was a tragic loss of jobs and the creation of poverty for most families who 
								 relied on their jobs at GM to support their families. So next time you go and think of buying a car dont buy a P.O.S. Rice Burner. Buy a good quality American made car. This is 
								 America not Japan or China.</h5></p>
								 <br>
								 <br>
								 <center><img src="gaga.jpg" alt=""></center>
								 <br>
								 <p><h5>Lady Gaga is in my time capsule for many reasons. She is a very talented artist who actually sings and is not dubbed over to make herself sound better.
								 Gaga also is not influenced by the media and what the tabloids have to say even when they made up that she was a man. Plus Lady Gaga's music is very catchy and is very different from other artists in her genre.
								 </h5></p>
								 <br>
								 <br>
								 <center><img src="adtr.jpg" alt=""></center>
								 <br>
								 <p><h5>A Day to Remember is in here not because it's my favorite band. They are in here to show how crappy newage metal has become. Newage metal is resorting to make songs all breakdowns 
								 and no catchy rythm or riffs. Most newage bands have one really easy riff they play throughout the whole song and either one or two long breakdowns. There is no musical talent at all in these newage metal bands like this.
								 <br>

								 <br>
								 <p><h5>My time capsule would not be complete with out a reference to the new 2010 Chevy Corvette. The new corvette has 638 horse power stock under the hood.
								 It is currently the fastest domestic sports car ever made. Plus it is really sleek looking and I would like to own one someday along with a Camaro and a Silverado.</h5></p>

								 <br>
								 <p><h5>One of the episodes of South Park made history by getting Terroist threats after its viewing. The episode had an ongoing joke about revieling 
								 Muhammed but never did show it. The network got terrorist threats for reshowing the episode and Comedy Central has not shown the episode since.</h5></p>

								 <center><img src="dio.jpg" alt=""><center>
								 <br>
								 <p><h5>Ronnie James Dio passed away this year. He was one of the original members of Black Sabbath. He is known for his hit song Holy Diver
								 and for being one of the best in the business.</h5></p>
		 						 <br>

								 <center><img src="my125.JPG" alt=""></center>
								 <br>
		 						 <p><h5>This is my 2005 Cr125. I have put this in my capsule seeing how it is the one of the last Honda two strokes still living.
								 Also because I want to compare the bike I have now with the one I might own in the future.</h5></p>
