		I had danced at Kathy's Dance Company ever since I was three. I started doing competition when i was in second grade. Ever since we have won many national championships. Our great teachers consist of Ms. Jessica, Ms. Tonya, Ms. Kendra, Ms. Tiffani, and last but not least Ms. Kathy. We offer classes in tap, jazz, lyrical, hip-hop, and ballet.

<p>
		Every year we attend around 5 competitions, and one nationals usually held in Illinois, or Ohio. I plan on dancing at Kathy's Dance through high school.</p>
