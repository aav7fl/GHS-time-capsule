Hey, I'm Nicholas Koster and this the Time Capsule I made for Mr. Dolloff's 5th
Hour Intro to Web Design class. It's finally open after 10 years. 
<br><br><br><br>
This is just a look back at where I was shortly before Graduation. I had a great
time at GHS, but I'm ready to move on to bigger things. I'm going to Western Michigan
University. I will be 18 when the Capsule is open for viewing. Look to the right.

<td>A great way to have fun was my church's youth group, the TYDE. We had a lot of fun
chilling out like playing video games, 4-square, BodyBody, Red Ball, PopPong, pool,
air hockey, table tennis, and foosball. We discussed God. 
A running gag was Nestle's Chunkys. Basically, nobody at the TYDE likes them because
the chocolate isn't really good and we all think it's weird of combining chocolate with
nuts and raisins. I guess it's not that bad of an idea, but the Cunky isn't really good.
So whenever a Chunky appeared, it'd get thrown. One time we had a Chunky Chucking Competition.</td>

<td><img src="capsuleComics.jpg"></td>
<td>The world of comic books really got my imagination going. It's kind of crazy, but
I think it's so neat how there's this whole different universe. I liked mostly Marvel's
superheroes, not DC. My favorites were Wolverine, Spider-Man, Captain America, and Daredevil.
It was also exciting to finally see their powers in action on the big screen. Right now in
2010, I am anticipating a long series of movies with all of them interacting together. Maybe
when this capsule is unlocked, there will be one in the works finally.
Outside of Marvel, I of course liked the funnies too, like Ballard Street, Zits, and
Garfield. My best friend in high school really liked comic books too, so this is a representation
of him too, kind of. </td>

<td>My first car: an Oldsmobile Bravada. I'm not sure what year it was / is, but who
cares? It gets me where I want to go. I guess it'll be important to know its year when
it's sold, but right now in 2010 I don't see that happening anytime soon. It doesn't
have any miles on it. So far I've been in two accidents. The first time someone backed
into me when I wasn't even moving! (I should've honked the horn) But his car, which looked
pretty new, got all the damage. The other accident I did the damage. I was parked 
real to the right in the garage and couldn't quite clear it. </td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td><img src="capsuleShoes.jpg"></td>
<td> I ran Cross Country all four high school years. Wow, it kind of feels weird to
type that. It's really neat for me who's not very athletic, no matter the skill level, everyone is on the same
playing field at once. It's really the only sport where the average are with the elite.
That's not true in sports like basketball and baseball. I hope I'm still running distance
sometime in the future. Everyone on the team was real nice too. I'm not very good at sprinting. </td>

<tr>
<td><img src="capsuleLogos.jpg"></td>
<td>In the world of sports, the 2009 Detroit Lions come off a 0-16 record beating Washington and
Cleveland. Top-pick Mathew Stafford proves to be a success and Calvin Johnson continues to
be one of the best recievers. The 09/10  Pistons fail to make the playoffs, as their
draft picks continue to be failures. The 09 Tigers lead the Centeral Division the whole year. . . .
up until August. The last few games of the season, they lead Minnesota by several games. Only
they loose those, are tied with Minnesota the last day, and have to play an extra game. They blow it.
And the Red Wings? Who cares. I hate them. I'd actually put a shirt of the teams in an actual capsule.

<tr>
<td><img src="capsuleAvatar.jpg"></td>
<td>I guess I'll include something I don't like. If I were to actually bury something 
so as to never see it again, it'd be Avatar. I hope when this capsule is opened, movies
really wont be in 3-D. It gives me a headache and it doesn't really work like it does in
Disney and the like. They say that 'People like it because it's in 3-D.' That's not true
at all. There was only one showing time to see it normally, so it's forcing you to see it
in 3-D.

<td><img src="bulldog.jpg"></td>
<td>Because I graduated in 2010, I feel it's a good idea to have some sort of representation of being
a Grandville Bulldog. If this was an actual capsule, I could throw in a lot of my old school work
and supplies. Grandville will seem so small in the future. </td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="imgWii.jpg"></td>
<td>The one I wonder most about my hobbies in the future is --- Will I still be playing video games?
I don't play them a ton now, but I want to know if they'll still be a big deal. Each year I play them
less and less. The most-used system in High School was the Wii. It came out freshman-year and I knew
that it'd be a great conclusion to my time of playing video games the most often.  </td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td><img src="capsuleCulvers.jpg"></td>
<td>Every Sunday I ate at Culver's. I hope to get a summer job there. There's good food there
and there's a wide variety of selections. Like, I didn't go out for lunch everyday at school,
so this was sort of like my Wendy's or JimmyJohn's. </td>
</tr>



<tr>
<td><img src="capsuleForHealthcare.jpg"></td>
<td>Just a historical note here. President Obama passed National Health Care for America. I don't have much of an
opinion of it yet since as of now in early 2010 I don't have to worry about since my parents
do. But I do think it's pretty neat Obama is delivering on some of the promises he made campaigning. 
A lot of people here in Grandville don't really like it, but the rest of America must.
