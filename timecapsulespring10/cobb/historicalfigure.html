<p><h4>Avi Arad</h4> is an Israeli-American businessman. 
He became the CEO of the company Toy Biz in the 1990s, and soon afterward became the chief creative officer 
of Marvel Entertainment, a Marvel director, and chairman, CEO and the founder of Marvel Studios.

<p>Born and raised in Giv'atayim, Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Arad came to the United States

<p>Along with Toy Biz co-owner Isaac Perlmutter, Avi Arad came into conflict with Carl Icahn and Ron Perelman 
over control of Marvel Comics in the wake of its 1996 bankruptcy. In the end, Arad and Perlmutter came out on 
top, with Toy Biz taking over Marvel Comics in a complicated deal that included obtaining the rights to Spider 
Man and other superheroes that Marvel had sold earlier. He was involved in Marvel's emergence from bankruptcy and 
the expansion of the company's profile through licensing and movies.

On July 4, 2003, Arad became a naturalized citizen of the United States.[

<h4>Amanda Laura Bynes </h4> (born April 3, 1986)  is an American actress, comedian, fashion designer, singer and voice 
actor. She was previously a show host of her own TV program The Amanda Show on Nickelodeon. After appearing in several 
successful television series (All That  and The Amanda Show) on Nickelodeon in the mid-to late 1990s and early 2000s, Bynes 
transitioned to a film career, starring in several films aimed at teenage audiences, including She's the Man (2006) and 
Hairspray (2007).

In 2006, Bynes was named one of Teen People's "25 Hottest Stars Under 25", and in 2007, she was on the Forbes list as
the 5th highest paid celebrity under 21, earning $2.5 million.


Early life
Bynes was born and raised in Thousand Oaks, California, the daughter of Lynn (née Organ), a dental assistant and office manager, 
and Rick Bynes, a dentist who also practiced stand-up comedy. Bynes has two older siblings, Tommy (born 1974), a chiropractor,
and Jillian (born 1983), who has a Bachelor of Arts in History from UCLA and has also acted. Bynes' maternal grandparents 
are from Toronto, Ontario and she is of Irish, Polish, Russian and Romanian descent. Her father is Catholic and her
mother is Jewish; she has described herself as Jewish, but has also stated "I haven't decided yet [on a religion].
I don't know yet exactly what I believe".

Career
In 1993, Bynes was trained as an actress by Arsenio Hall and Richard Pryor at a comedy camp, and began professionally acting 
at the age of seven, appearing in a television advertisement for Buncha Crunch candies. During her childhood, she also 
appeared on stage in versions of Annie, The Secret Garden, The Music Man and The Sound of Music. After taking acting 
classes, Bynes became a regular cast member of Nickelodeon's Figure It Out and All That (both in 1996). Bynes remained a 
regular cast member on All That until its presumed cancellation in 2000, though she appeared in the sketches since shooting 
and preparing as the star of her own sketch show The Amanda Show, also on Nickelodeon. The Amanda Show features a combination 
of comical skits and sketches, including Amanda Bynes playing Judge Trudy, a judge based on Judge Judy that always rules in 
kids' favor, and Penelope Taynt, an Amanda-obsessed fan.

Bynes made her film debut in 2002's modest box office success, Big Fat Liar, where she starred opposite Frankie Muniz.
Her first solo leading role was in 2003's What a Girl Wants as Daphne Reynolds, co-starring with Colin Firth, Oliver James 
and Kelly Preston. Subsequently, Bynes starred in The WB Television Network's sitcom What I Like About You and had voice parts 
in 2003's Charlotte's Web 2: Wilbur's Great Adventure and 2005's CGI animated comedy, Robots. She also co-starred in an episode 
of The Nightmare Room as Danielle Warner, and in Arliss as Crystal Dupree. Bynes appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair's July 
2003 edition with nine of Hollywood's most popular female young stars, including Lindsay Lohan, Hilary Duff, Alexis Bledel, 
Raven-Symoné, Evan Rachel Wood, the Olsen Twins, and Mandy Moore. Although she is often compared with them, Bynes has said 
that "It's like being the hot girl at the high school party. I was never that girl. I grew up with terrible acne and feeling 
insecure. I was tall and skinny. I didn't feel pretty at all, and guys didn't even like me. That's why I got into comedy." 
Bynes has also said that her relatability to teenage audiences may stem from the fact that she is "more similar to them than 
some... socialite or whatever".
