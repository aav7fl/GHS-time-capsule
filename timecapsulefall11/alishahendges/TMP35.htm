	     <p><h3><font color="#ffffff">Dear Alisha,</p>

	<br>I really hope you open this letter. You are 28 right now.  I hope you are happy with life and are in love with someone or have a family.  I hope by now you have a new car than your wonderful black grand prix. I wonder if Donny is still dating Austynn or if he has a new girlfriend or wife. If you haven't already went to Africa, stop reading this and go now! How did college ever workout for you? Did you make the right choice of what to go for? Who is your best friend? Do you and Maggie still talk? Are you and Danielle still best friends?  What ever happened with Brooke Farmer? I hope you still go out to the bars and have fun on weekends. What types of clothes are in style now? Do you still wear skinny jeans? Or fight into them lol. </h3></p></br>


	<p><h3> <br>I was writing this on December 9, 2011 in intro to web. I'm sitting next to Ashley Bradstreet and David Klunder is next to her. We fight on a daily bases. David always tells us he would rather have a beer than talk to us.  David secretly loves me and loves when we get in fights everyday. I tell him all the songs on the radio are for him. Our song is "Sexy and I know it" by LMFAO. Ashley always has to help us on our projects because we play bubble shooter instead of listening to Dolloff. All of us are slackers. I honestly still have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing for this project. Nikki Steenwyk sits to the right of me and I make fun of her for getting credit carded by Jake Erhardt. My 18th Birthday is in 5 days and I'm super excited. I'm renting a party bus and im nervous how it's gonna turn out. I'm getting a tattoo, which my mom does not approve of. Did you ever end up getting it? I'm currently working two jobs, Peppino's and Brann's. I 'm pretty happy with my life right now.  Can you believe how fast high school flew by? Last summer was so fun.  Danielle and I became best friends and spent the whole summer together and going on her boat and to the beach. You should be skipping school right now instead of writing this because next semester absences count for exams.</h3></p></font>
