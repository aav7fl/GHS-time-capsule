				<p>Dang. Well happiness is... Well you know... Really hard to describe in just a little paragraph or so. Not only describing happiness, but what it is defined as by me... Yeah. That's tough. I'd have to say that happiness to me is being able to smile and see and enjoy all the good things in life, even when a lot of stressful things are happening.</p>

				<p>I could also say a lot about what freedom is. Sure, it would be easy to say that freedom is being able to do whatever you want... but there is definitely more to that. I don't often think that many courageous people have died to keep the freedom of our country intact.</p>

				<p>In 2011, you read a book called the Perks of being a Wallflower. I loved this book because I could really relate to how "charlie," thought about life and just about growing up. Hey... You should reread it for old times sake... <br> "And in that moment, I swear we were infinite." <3 </p>
