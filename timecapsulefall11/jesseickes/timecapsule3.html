			<h2>
				A few definitions of things and how i would define them right now.
			</h2>
			<p>
				My definition of happiness is a very simple definition of it. it is pretty much being able to look back at your life and
				not regret enough things or there be too many sad things in your life that you cant smile when you look back. happyness at the moment is just being able to smile for the majority of the average day and not let it be a fake smile.
			</p>
<br>
			<p> 
				My definition of freedom is well... there are too many kinds of freedom. there could be freedom from government and all that. which that is being able to practice your own religion whenever and whatever kind you want in a private area. 
				but then there could also be freedom from pain or from anything else like that. freedom of just doing what you want when you want. not having a relationship just doing whatever you want for your own happiness and no one elses.
			</p>
<br>
			<p>
				My prediction of technology in 10 years is that tablets will be able to be rolled up and see through so you can walk and see where you are going
				while you are walking. they would be able to rolled up and folded to fit any size screen tablet you would want in your pocket. televisions will be wherever you drag them. 
				televisions will be totally interactive. they will be able to be on everywall. they will justt be integrated into the walls of each house. you will be able to drag them around the walls to wherever you want them and in whatever room you want them.
