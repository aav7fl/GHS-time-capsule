			<h2>
				A Letter To Myself In 10 Years
			</h2>
			<p>
				I, the younger version of yourself, am 17 and a senior in highschool. i want to do something with physics when i grow upi am doing this during exam because i procrastinate like crazy!
				hopefully when you are reading this you wont be the same lazy procrastinater like i am now. i am going out with isabelle angela pokora right now. however
				only about two months ago you broke up with your girlfriend who you were going out with for a year and a little more than 9 months.
				i am currently struggling inbetween two girls. i stil really care for page A LOT its just i wasnt totally happy with her.. atleast that what i think. im not toally sure... 
				hopefully by the time you are reading this you will have finally really made up your mind on what kind of a girl you like or just what kind of girl you want to live with.
				i am kind of stressed out because i am trying my best to keep "payge" still happy and still be in a happy relationship with izzy. Which is very tough to do.
				it is currently 10:11AM and i am in web design class taking a exam for the end of the semester. i just took a calc exam which i am sure i did really good but i didnt know how to do the cost related problem.
				i am listening to the skyrim soundtrack which consists of 4cds and i just got it in the mail yesterday. also i ordered it early enough so i got it signed by the composer himself! And it is amazing! :D skyrim is your favorite game ever. it is exploring caves and fighting dragons and completing quests given to you.
				so yeah that is about what sums up my life! OH! i am also in FIRST Robotics Competition where you get to build 120 pund robots from scratch. it is really fun and awesome and takes up a lot of time but its worth it!
				i also get to miss alot of school because of it! :) i also love modest mouse the band and coldplay and many others, just pretty much whatever music izzy listens to.
				So there now that about sums up my life right now i assume. mmhmm. well talk to you in ten years...
