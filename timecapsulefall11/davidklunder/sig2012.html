					 <br>"Maybe it’s my own fault. Maybe I led you to believe it was easy when it wasn’t. Maybe I made you think my highlights started at the free throw line, and not in the gym. Maybe I made you think that every shot I took was a game winner. That my game was built on flash, and not fire. Maybe it’s my fault that that you didn’t see that failure gave me strength; That my pain was my motivation. Maybe I led you to believe that basketball was a God given gift, and not something I worked for… every single day of my life. Maybe I destroyed the game. Or maybe your just making excuses."<br>-Michael Jordan

					 <br>100 years by Five for Fighting, let's me know to cherish every moment. Just a cool, and moving song, there's a commercial with this song playing and it makes my dad tear up. Which if I were to see the commercial when I had kids that were growing up, I probably would as well. <br>

					 Stepbrothers was one of my favorite movies, with Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, it was always a source for great quotes and me and some of my best friends always called eachother and told others we were brothers, to the point where my friends called my dad, dad.
