				 To me the definition of happiness, is what brings you joy in your life. Happiness comes in moments that take your breathe away. Make all of your dreams come true and you'll have happiness, nothing is impossible. Happiness can be determined by your own actions, some blame others for their lack of happiness, but it's on you to find others that make you happy and bring you that joy. 28 year old David Klunder, if you haven't already, find the joy in your life.

				 To me the definition of freedom, is doing what you want to do, without going against the law. Being allowed to chase your dreams no matter what it takes, and not being cut down by others on the way.

		       Dear 28 year old David,

Ten years already since you were sitting in your 5th hour knowing you ruled the school, sitting next to Ashley Bradstreet trying to make awkward hand holding moments that we would laugh about, bickering with Alisha Hendges and laughing with Nikki about that crazy night at Katelyn Schafer's.  Often finding yourself playing bubble shooter instead of worrying about HTML's or Div's etc.  10 years since you were going to the Y after school with Tim Steffes and Alex Mckenna, 10 years from most likely signing with Grand Rapids Community College to further your baseball career.  10 years from when you had your first job at Ucello's, are you still working there, did you work your way up through the program, or did you get drafted to play the game that you love for the rest of your youth and active years.  10 years since your best friend was Jared Sebright, is he still your best friend, and did you become his next door neighbor like you said you would.  How are your grandparents doing, like your entire family they meant the world to you as a 17-18 year old.  Are you taking your grandma and maybe even your grandpa to church?  How's your dad, did he find someone else, and where is he living, you better go and spend time with him as often as possible as well as your mom they made you who you are today, kind of sucks having to pay for your own bills now you know where your dad was coming from when he'd bang on the door saying, "get out of the shower Dave!"  Do you spend time and not bicker with your mom and help her whenever she needs it, you better.  10 years from the days of waking up at 6:45 to the song God Gave Me You, going to school, seeing everyone there, how many of them do you still see?  Have you gone back to check on your elders, like Mr. Vanderslice? Dr. Morris? Ms. Wiest? Mrs. Brown? How are they doing?  Did you go back and thank Mr. Leonardo for giving you another chance? Are you still bitter towards Mr. VanderWall about the basketball situation?  10 years from yelling a crossed the room to Mr. Herbert or him asking ANYONE WANNA BUY A POP?!?!  All the memories and sayings you and Jared made for everyone and yourselves, rock paper scissors to see who would have to give Herbert the new bathroom pass, will you remember Emily Salzwedel? Remember yelling I'D RATHER HAVE A BEER!  Or that year when Jake Parks, Jared Sebright and you would yell SCISSOR! from locker bank to locker bank.  How about the first day Coach Ungrey said you were going to practice with the varsity, go back and thank him, but then you had to call your mom to bring you your cleats, remember those type of things your parents did for you, are you married, and do you have kids, where do you live?  10 years past some of the greatest years of your lives, how was college? Did you graduate? You better remember those days, because sitting here right now I can't believe my little league days are over or going out to the courthouse to play ball are over, driving by Dale Earnhardt Dr. is that sign still there?  Are your kids going to play for Western and wear that Royal Blue?
Are you still a Pistons fan? Do you make sure to go and watch games with your dad, take him to a game if you get the chance, he made your dreams of going to a game come true, remember when you were the junior captain at the Pistons vs. Celtics game? Remember the Piston parties you would have with your friends? Be sure to remember those things, those are some things you may not be able to do as often, so cherish every moment as you get older. Do you remember your first home run off Travis Rosinski? What a game that was! Appreciate being to play at that level day in and day out and to always be on the best team, in any of the sports, they're was atleast a year where you dominated and in basketball and baseball, years and years, appreciate what your coaches did for you, espiecally the best coach you ever had, which is your dad. Who was always a terrific coach in baseketball, but his baseball record as your coach was even more memorable, Him and Mr. Seely held probably the best record as coaches at Western, and you and your great friend Ryan Seely were 120-26 together playing ball. I could go on and on about all the memories from these days in your life, but I'll stop here, remember these times in your life, these were the times when you were just a kid, living it up, playing sports, learning from your elders and peers on how to treat others, if you get a chance to thank all those people, do it, because they made you into the man, husband? dad? pro baseball player? or whatever you have become. Remember this days, and cherish these moments, these moments will never be the same no matter what. Do everything through God, love your family and friends and thank the people that influenced you into being the person you are today. If you haven't already, find the joy in your life. <br> Sincerely, 17 year old David. Letter finished Dec. 7, 2011 (Jared Sebright's Bday, Call Him!)
