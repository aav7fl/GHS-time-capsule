								<h3>How I define Happiness:</h3>
								
								<p><img src="happy.png" width="110" height="110" alt="testimg" title="testimg" class="img-left" /> 
								Happiness to me is waking up with a sense of knowing what you want, knowing how to get there, and then going for it with everything you've got. The journey of trying
								to achieve things that some people think you can't. The journey of shaping and molding yourself. I believe you don't "find" yourself, you create yourself. That's happiness,
								knowing what you want and creating yourself to get it. If your vision changes, you change and adapt, learning and shaping yourself to fit the circumstance. But mainly,
								Happiness is being happy :)
								</p>

								<h4>How I define Freedom:</h4>
								<p><img src="freedom.png" width="110" height="110" alt="testimg" title="testimg" class="img-right" />
								
								Freedom is the ability to go after your goal, like I stated above in happiness you need to find what you want, and mold yourself, then go after it with everything you have and more
								knowing at the end of each day you did everything in your power to get to where you want to be. Freedom is simply your ability to do that. Freedom is your ability to be happy.
								  </p>
								
								
								<h3>My Prediction of what Technology you have.</h3>
								<pre>Well I'd guess that touchscreens have phased on and its now like touch
projection, that way you don't scatch your screen. Probably got
some fancy projection HD 3D TV's and computers. I'd guess that credit 
cards are different in a way that identity theft is nearly impossible. 
You're probably reading website in your self-driving hovercar. Hoping 
that they found a cure for cancer by now. Wondering if they're cloning 
yet. Hmm. Well you know technology better than I do.

											<h3>Branden Schwandner</h3>
											<p>Branden dated Courtney for a while before Mitch. Worked at Rainbow for a while but then quit after the Mitch and Courtney stuff went down. You and him continued to go 
											golfing even though they had broken up, I hope you still do. He is one of the funniest kids I've ever known and he is just a sweet dude.

											<h3>Colin Boer</h3>
											<p>Colin worked at Rainbow but recently left. He was the short little goofy kid that went to Jenison. You and him parking lot idle drag raced where you weren't allowed to tap the gas
											and the first one out of the parking lot won. He was a funny dude.

											<h3>Austin Mayer</h3>
											<p>You probably still talk to Austin because you have known him since he was born. He is your life long friend and a good kid. He is possibly too smart for his own good.
											One of the strongest right winged republicans I know and its crazy. But he was the Tails to your Sonic when you were kids and he should always be your bud. Keep an eye on him.</p>
