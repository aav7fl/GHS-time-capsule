		 <h2>A significant piece of literature from 2011...</h2><p>

		 Though many may disagree, I think this book is a significant piece of literature. For one, it's the first actual "non-school" novel you read since you quit reading in 7th grade. Mom, Dad, and Dane were very proud. Second, this book is the best book I've ever read! Right now, I'm on page 206 I think.. You probably have a different favorite by now, but I bet if you picked up this book and started reading it, you would remember how much you loved it! You had never dreamed of reading an actual book in high school, especially one from the Twilight saga! But after you saw <i>Breaking Dawn</i>, you had to read it, and I'm glad I made that decision for you. :) This book made me remember how much I loved to read when I was younger, and how there actually <i>are</i> other things to do besides Facebook and watch TV. ;)

<h2> A significant movie from 2011...</h2><p>

Well, the Harry Potter series ended this year. <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2</i> came out in July, 2011. It was heartbreaking that the series ended, but the movie was so incredibly good! You saw it twice, and it should be coming out on DVD/BluRay soon.. I hope you're not laughing at "DVDs" yet... But this movie is significant, for one, like I said, it ended the 10 year Harry Potter movie series... Which was a huge chunk of your childhood. I wonder if Daniel Radcliffe and all of the cast ever starred in any other movies? Guess I'll know when you read this. But anyways, I would consider this a very significant movie from 2011, along with some other of my favorites such as <i>The Hangover Part II, No Strings Attached, Just Go With It, Your Highness,</i> and <i> Bridesmaids.</i> I hope you remember how much of a movie buff you were! ;)

<h2>A significant song from 2011...</h2><p>

"We Found Love" by Rihanna is a very significant song from 2011. It's a really good song, and is currently the top song on iTunes right now.. I hope you're not laughing.. I really like this song, and I think it's a great song because it's kind of saying that love doesn't have to be perfect. Even in the worst of situations, love can be found. I think the song is really catchy, and I love Rihanna as a pop artist. Some of her other songs weren't really that good, but I love this one! I hope the link I post to YouTube still works because you'll remember instantly this moment right now when you listen to the song...<p>
