    <h2>Dear Emilee in the future,</h2>
    <h3>
	It's been ten years since you were a senior in high school. Ten years is a long time, I bet a lot has changed. Currently, I am an average, happy, awkward teenager trying to do their best in this world. I live with Mom and Dad, plan on going into art at Grand Valley next fall, and am enjoying the benefits of being a senior. I have many friends at school, but none of them are very close to me. My best friend is Katie, whom I sleep across the hall from. One day she will get married, and I'm pretty sure I will die without her. Church has been really great. I started playing bass on the worship team this year, continued to go to Attic After School twice a week (hopefully three days a week next January!), and attend youth group events and Sunday morning worship. Last month, Dan's situation was discovered, and it hit us hard. We are all struggling, and it's hard to trust God that thing will get better, but we are recovering. I think. Soon things will be normal again, and trust in Dan will be restored. I know that the Father is the only who will help us through these dark times. <br></br>
	
	I have goals that I want to have happen in my future, but who knows what God's plans are? I wanted to start college (which I'm terrified of, by the way) in art history, and then work my way into an actual art major. Graphic and web design is also on the table right now. I feel that I have the potential to be a great artist, if I practiced more often and was more assertive in my work. I want to become more involved in church. Whether it be taking over Attic After School, Worship team, Children's ministry, or even a mentor to the youth group, I want to be a part of the church. I think one day I want to get married. As I get older, I know I will desire a husband more, because I have noticed this trend in my sisters. I am currently content being single, and love the freedom I have. Part of my future plans as a single person includes living or going somewhere new. I want to live in the city, live in Canada (Prince Edward's Island?) or maybe just attend a distant college. I have been sheltered for my entire life, and I want to experience this world in a different light. I want to see God's creation and be part of it. I would like to be a mom, and feel that I would make a good mother. If the Lord blesses me on that way, I would be very grateful.<br></br>
	So continue life. Live onwards, and don't look back for too long. I know that there are great things in my future, both happy and sad. I predict siblings will get married, Dan will struggle, and grand parents will pass away, possibly parents. Cameron will do something dangerously bad, and make mom worry. Becki will have children, I will have relationships, good and bad, but throughout all this turn and turmoil, I know one thing for certain. My God will NEVER leave me or forsake me. <br></br>
		For the Glory of God,
			18 year old Emilee
