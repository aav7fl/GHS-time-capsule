<p> Hi future me. It's Erik from 2011. I'm in 10th grade, and I'm 17 right now. I'm making this for my Into to web design class with Mr. Dollof right now. Right now, my favorite classes are Pre-AP CTAL-10 (Composition through American Lit.) and AP US History (APUSH). Mr. Dollof told us that we'll be opening these in 2020, so by now, you're... what? 25? 26? Either way, you've no doubt graduated college, have a (hopefully) successful job, and I (possibly) are married and have a family. I really have no clue what I want to do as a job in the future, but I hope that sometime between now and 2020, when you're reading this, I will figure out just what it is I want to do. While I AM happy with my life right now, I have a few things that I hope to acomplish within the next 10 years, and I hope that by this time you (I) have acomplished them. First off, I hope that the move to Minnesota after graduating High School went well, and that you transitioned well into your new life. I hope that you did well in High School, and eventually, did well in College, and have a good job now. Whatever job you DO have, I hope that you're happy with it. I wish that I could travel forward in time to chat with you, and to find out what my life is TRULY going to be like in 10 or 20 years.
