			<b>Happiness</b> is the illusion of feeling joy.  Sometimes we enjoy this distraction.  Yes, it makes us feel good.  But my argument for it is just as week as my argument against it.  It's more of a feeling that we'd like to spend time in, but we must eventually move on out of it and on to other things.  So to simply say, happiness is whatever you take out of it.  Maybe it's something that gives you joy, and maybe it's something that puts a smile on your face.  Either way, I refuse to waste the rest of my life philosophizing about what it is.  It's more than we can understand, as most emotions are, and completely relative.

			<p>The great blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach; but we shut our eyes, and like people in the dark, we fall foul upon the very thing we search for, without finding it.</p>
			
			<p class="align-right"> - Seneca (7 B.C. - 65 A.A.)</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Freedom</b> is having the option of free will for many choices.   Of course, you can argue against this again saying we are shunned away from entirely free thought.  Our race is truncated by not asking "why" enough.  We often pass by events not wondering about them, maybe it's because people just can't think fast enough, but I hope that is not the case...  Although, I sadly find this true in many cases.  People can't think fast enough, that is why I feel  I deal so well with computers, because many times my mind is free  of any restraints and can think at speeds that usually gives  technology (at the current time) a run for its money.

			<h3>My Words</h3>
			<p>Don't get the wrong idea.  I don't think it's a waste of time to be happy.  I feel just like everyone else, but more at a reserved expression or understanding.  Clear thoughts happen to trump my weak understanding of feelings.</p>
