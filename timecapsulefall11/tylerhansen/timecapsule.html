		<p>So it should be about ten year sice I wrote this to you. All I know right now is i plan to join the army out of high school I hope that was worth it. Dont forget about mom ok she is problly mostly gona by now so be strong and make sure she see's some grandkids and give her my love I know she will need it. Also try to get to chuch more often I know its not the most fun thing in the world but it'll save your life.</p>
		<p>Dont forget your dreams of Eourpe, and New York becomeing a Diver and doing a whole bunch of other things. Now it may not be easy but dont give up on any of those things. If you dont mind I would like to have a family one day so work on that a little you should rise em in the country maybe down in Georgia.</p>
		
		<h3>Freedom</h3>
		<p>Freedom is the core of our lives and many people tend to forget that it dosnt come free</p>
		<h3>Happiness</h3>
		<p>Happiness is when there is no other place you want to be in the world right now.</p>
