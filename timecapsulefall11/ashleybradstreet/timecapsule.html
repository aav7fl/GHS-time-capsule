					<img src="freedom.png"><br>
					<small>My definition of freedom is doing whatever I want. Freedom is what allows me to grow as a person.  Without freedom
					I don't think there would be happiness. I think freedom and happiness go hand-in-hand.</small> <br>
					  <img src="happiness.png" alt=""><br>
<small>					To define happiness is really hard to do.  I guess happiness is whatever brings you joy. So to me happiness is lazy days watching movies.  It's hanging out with my friends, doing anything and everything to keep ourselves from going insanely boredom.  It's finding a really awesome band or artist that nobody knows about yet.  It's jamming out in my car with the windows down.  </small>
					<img src="tech.png"><br>
					<small>In 2021 I think technology will have progressed exponentially.  I think everything will be
					faster and smaller.  Wi-fi will be everywhere.  Cell phones will basically have everything that 
					computers have today.  Computers will be smart maybe smarter than humans.</small>
