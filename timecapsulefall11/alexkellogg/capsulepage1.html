                  <p>Hello my future self, I hope that you are well, have a job you love, and good friends. If all goes as planned, you're a millionaire by now. So get a time machine, go back in time, and give me some money so I can get myself a decent car! Some life advice would be much appreciated as well, I'm sure you know all my problems right now haha. Anyways, I'll let me go now... By the way, if you dont listen to dubstep anymore, I don't want to be you when I grow up >:(</p>
                  <p>I think that happiness is having a good time, and having good friends. Wanting to live every day to the fullest, making others smile, and doing what you like to do. Not letting others decide how you live your life, live and let live.</p>
                  <p>Freedom is being able to do what you want when you want, as long as its not harmfull to anyone else or anything thats not yours.</p>
                  <p>Ten years from now technology will either be just about the same as it is now, or it will be very much further advanced. Technology advances at an exponential rate, the more of it there is, the faster it gets better. Plus it all depends on how hard mankind works on it, so its really on the shoulders of the youth of today.</p>

                          <p>By literature of our time, I mean the books i've been forced to read in my junior year. And so far we've had to read The Samurai's Garden, Antigone, and Things Fall Apart.</p>
