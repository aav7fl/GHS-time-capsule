<h4>A significant piece of literature</h4>
<center>
<br><s>Hey! It's 2011 and this is your senior year at Grandville High School.  I have been visiting Bethel Abundant Life Center Church, even though I am a member at MMBC. I think It would be good for me to be away form my church "friends" and my family. </s></br>
<br> <b>After high school I plan to attend Wayne State University to major in business and minor in urban studies. Im debating on rather I should attend Wayne County Community College for freshman and sophomore year and live with grandma then transfer to Wayne state for my last two years and live on campus.</b></br>
<br> <u> I currently work at McDonalds; I have been working there for a little over seven months. After school is out I'll be applying for other jobs in addition to McDonalds so I can save money for college. </u></br>

<br> <i>Right now involved in the youth choir at Messiah Missionary Baptist Church, I have also been working at McDonalds for over 7 months. I don't really like it there but I don't complain because I like the paychecks...sometimes. I am also a dancer at MMBC. I really enjoy dancing and singing even though I don't think I that good at either one especially singing. Last year Andrea and Alexis danced in the talent show and we got 2nd place (Y@Y!). I'm really excited for college next year, I'm excited to be on my own and take care of my self, be independent.</i> </br>
<br> <small>Right now I have been struggling because all my friends except for Candace Miller and Samantha Banka, have moved out of state or graduated from high school. So I am really learning how to deal with problems on my own, without confiding in anyone. I believe that this is going to be a good experience. I'm hoping that this will help me be more independent and prepare me for college and being an adult. I am also seeing that there people in my life who don't really care about me, and what is good for me, they are only worried about them and what is important right now. I can't think about right now and still be ready for college and being an adult when that time comes.</small> </br>
