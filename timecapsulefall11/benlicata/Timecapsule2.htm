<h2>Letter</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, if you are reading this now then you've made it this far in life and you should be proud of that. I know that this is weird reading a letter from your past, it's wierd for me back here in 2011 so we're in the same boat. I'm sure you forgot about this letter over the years with all of the excitement and all of life. Honestly I don't know what do say, which is always why I hated to do them before because there isn't much you could write to yourself about, it's not like I could coach you on how to live the next...last...ten years of your life. All I can really do is just ask questions. You know I could spawn a boat load of questions so I'll try and restrain myself, it will be a blessing for the both of us. 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, ten years it's been eh, then you should have had enough time to finish that story we've always been working on, in truth I really want to know how it turns out there's so much stuff happening in it and it's great really. I sure hope that you remembered to have Mrs. Fischer/Mr. Selk/Mr. Long the parts you worked out during...my next ten years, your last ten years. How's the Presequeal coming along, Both Mr. Long and Mrs. Fischer have expressed their want to learn about Jerdin's history, I would have put more on computer but I am falling behind in typing up my first one so hopefully by the time you read this you have gotten that problem under control and flying through. And, for some bizarre reason, you decided to quit then get back in to it! That is one of the things that has kept me thinking and kept me going on. If you lose that then...I don't want to know what I become. My writing has inspired me a lot and I want to keep that, oh I so want to keep that if it's the last thing I'd give up.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that you put Grandma's money to good use, I'd be disappointed if you just wasted it on things that you would get tired of quickly. Games, it depends on the game, like the new Zelda game that came out last month for me. You should have used the money for college so you could get a job to sustain yourself. I can only hope that Mom and Dad are still around. Is Jen still sitting around the house doing nothing or did she finally get a job somewhere nice? I just hope I would be kind enough to give her a ride when she needs it as soon as I get my license.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26 yrs. old...seems like an eternity for me to image, but I'm sure that it went by so fast that you can't even remember most of it. I would put something in here on a very personal scale but I can already picture you getting embbarrassed over it so I'll leave it out. {grinns after looking at the preview} Of course the stupid program can't read tabs...goes and does them now...Eh they need a space between them too aggie!...That looks better. found a way to do spacing...&-n-b-s-p-; just take out the dashes :)

<h2>Prediction of technology ten years from now</h2>
<h3>
I predict that Techology will be a bit more advanced then the technology at this time (2011-2012), but not a whole lot. There are Ipods, Cell Phones, Flat screen TV's, Nooks, All kinds will probably be out of date by the time this gets opened in 2020 or so. I'm not sure what kind of gadges there will be in that amount of time, but it can't be too much more right?
