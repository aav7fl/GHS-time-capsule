		     <br>
				 <br>
		 <img src="mybanner4.gif">
		    <p align="left">The most significant song, or songs were "Tattoos on this Town," by Jason Aldean. This song as a lot of meaning to it; its saying that they left there mark on the town, and that they've made
				lots of memories. Another significant song is "When I look at you," by Miley Cyrus. It talks about always looking up to someone. These songs are very significant to me.</p> 
				<br> 
	   <img src="mybanner5.gif">
		    <p align="left">This is a very significant quote and its my favorite quote: <font color="#ff66cc">"The moment you have in your heart this extraordinary thing called love and feel the depth, 
				the delight, the ecstasy of it, you will discover that for you the world is transformed."</font> 
        <font color="#00ffff">Jiddu Krishnamurti</font> </p>
				<br>
				<img src="mybanner6.gif">
				<br>
				<p align="left">A very significat piece of literature would have to have been The Lord of the Flies, written by William Golding. It's about a group of British boys whose plan is shot and hit down
				and ends up stuck on a deserted island, trying to govern themselves but doesn't go as plan.</p>
				<br>
				<img src="mybanner7.gif" alt="">
				<br>
				<p align="left">A significant movie, or movies, was the Twilight Sagas. These movies consist of Twilght, New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn. It's significant to me because I love the detail they put into the movies
				and it's such a big hit all over the world. Twilight grosses over $7 million in ticket sales alone, in Nov. of 2008. (Grossed $35.7 million on opening day). The most recent of the movies, probably the best movie 
				everyone has been waitng for, that came out last month is Breaking Dawn: Part 1, (Part 2 will be out November 16th, 2012). Bella marries Edward, she gets pregnant, and is forced to deal with it because the baby is
				slowing taking her life away, leaves you hanging as Bella opens her eyes as a vampire.</p>
