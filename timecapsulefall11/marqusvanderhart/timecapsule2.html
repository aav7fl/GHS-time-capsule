		       Happiness- A lot of people think happiness is having fame, fortune, and being
					  popular or famous... but I think happiness is more like enjoying your life and just
						loving your friends and family and always thinking about god. That just my deffinition.

		      <p>Hello future Marqus, it's kind of weird writing this letter to you</p>
					<p>and dont know exactly what to say. I feel like your living a very</p><p> successful 
				  life and living the single life and hopefully no kids yet.</p><p>I just hope 
					you havent made a really dumb mistakes like you did</p><p>as a kid, because mistakes
					as an adult are more serious. As I'm typing</P><p> this I feel like I know alot but I bet
					 you know alot more as a  </p><p>twenty-seven year old.  
	           I know you didn't do your best as a high school<p> student but I know you're more educated 
						 about stuff that matters in life <P>like God, family, friends, and your career
						 Just remember that as long as<p> you pray and keep faith in god, everything will be alright.
						  I hope you<p> changed a lot from what I am because I'm just like my father and you don't<p>
							know how much I've despised that all my life. 
	               <p style="text-indent: 30px">Sincerely, the past YOU, Marqus Vander Hart	</div>
