# GHS-time-capsule

GHS Time Capsules put together by Grandville High School students in their website creation class under Spencer Dolloff.

A large portion of files were backed up from the FTP server by a student before the website went dark. Any pages that are not present were unfortunately never backed up, or remain hidden to us.

This is a _best effort_ attempt to recover those webpages for our class reunion:

- There seems to be an entire `/students/` directory missing from the backup. Any links to these bios will be broken.
- Music files were removed
- ghsdawgs.com was replaced in any linked pages
- Some pages may still be broken due to improper link creation. I did my best to correct _some_ of these (300+ links)
- When in doubt, view the raw files from their source: https://github.com/aav7fl/GHS-time-capsule/tree/main/vault
