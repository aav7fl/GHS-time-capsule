	          	        Hay Joe<br> 
<br><p>It has been several years since you have seen this page and no doubt things have changed in these few years. Since you are reading this page you obviously aren't dead and also there is still electricity so the nation probably hasn't been destroyed yet. The family is probably a lot different you are out of high school and I hope that you have continued to be success full and I even more hope that you have continued to follow after god.</p>
<br> <p>More than anything I need you continue on with living the life that you were living now. No I take that back I need you to live better than you are living right now remember our goals are and always must be to live better than we were yesterday.</p>

<br><p>There are many things that you had and maybe still have to be thankful for; you have a full and loving family, a purpose in your life, a fair and loving God, and every thing you ever wanted or needed. So ten or how ever many years it is from when you wrote this stay true
to the things that you were thankful for god will always be with us he was with us now and will be with you in the future. Now it is your job to keep the rest of the family in line and to be an example to those around you on what
a beliver can do.</p>

<br> <p>Keep in touch and be nice to the family even the cousins and above all live for god.</p>
<br><p>I wish you the best of luck.</p>
<br><p>Sincerely Yourself Joe Dubois</p>
