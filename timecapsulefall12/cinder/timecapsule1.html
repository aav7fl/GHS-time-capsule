							<align="left">	Dear Claire,<p>
Well it's been about 10 years since you graduated high school. I'm sure you're either graduated from college or almost done with it, so congratulations! Right now you think you know what you want to do with your life but you can always change your mind so whatever you're doing, I'm sure you're doing a good job at it. I'm writing this letter on your 18th birthday, December 12th of 2012. You just had a great birthday party with confetti cake and mint chocolate chip ice cream, your favorite! Don't forget to always thank your family for what they have done for you. They always try their best to make you happy. Now we both know that you and Sean are still together, but if he hasn't put a ring on that finger you need to have a talk with him! He's a good match for you so don't ever let him get away.<p>
 Also, don't forget to pray. It's one of the few things that are free and can help you through anything. God has a plan for you and if you follow it you will be the happiest person on this planet. Make sure you thank Him for everything. 
With love,<p>
The 18 year old version of you.

		       <center>Happiness<p>
					 	Happiness is something that only you can make happen in your life. Money, people, and objects won't give you happiness. You have to be content with what you have and what you're doing to achieve happiness.<p>
Happiness for me is accepting my grades and being proud of them, knowing that I did all I could to get what grades I got in all of my classes.

		 <div id="rightcolumn">
		 
		       <center>Freedom<p>
						Freedom is the ability to choose what you want to do with yourself regardless of what you have done or where you have been. Freedom is not letting anyone stop you from achieving your dreams.<p>
Freedom is knowing that I have made bad decisions that I'm not proud of but still being able to live my life with no fear of not being able to do something or go somewhere because of them.
