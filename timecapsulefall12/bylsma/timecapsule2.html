		 <h2>The Future!</h2><br>
		 <p style="text-indent:30px;">
		 My guess is that the future will awesome in terms of technology. The PS4 will will be even awesomer, even the XBOX 720 will be better. The iPhone 8 will be the first made mostly of glass. There will most likely be entirely new techy products for us in the next ten years, and I can't wait!

		 <h2>Music</h2>
		 I really like OneRepublic, Gangnam Style recently came out, and there are a bunch of boy bands out. They'll die out, but they keep coming back. I don't mind The Wanted, they have	a couple good songs.<br><br>

		<h2>Books</h2>
		Not really into reading much, but I like Harry Potter and Rick Riordan's books a lot.<br><br>
		
		<h2>Movies</h2>
		The Avengers recently came out, it was pretty good. I really like Pirates of the Caribbean (the fourth one is out right now), Sherlock Holmes, and any spoofs. I also just saw The Campaign, and that was hilarious.<br><br>

		<h2>Games</h2>
		Minecraft is pretty awesome, though I don't play it much anymore. The newest Call of Duty is Black Ops II, which is okay i guess. SSX is pretty awesome, I'm really good at it too.
