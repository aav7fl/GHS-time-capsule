	<h3>
I think 10 years from now I will be out of college with a teaching degree, have a husband and hopefully have two kids, a little girl and boy. I'm sure you'll have a nice house (the one you've always wanted). I hope I'm still in touch with all of my friends and family. I hope I can help out with as many activities through my kid's school and continue helping out at Grandville. I hope I have a successful job as I go into early elementary education. I hope that my family goes to Christ Lutheran and grow into a good and strong relationship with God. I think there will be new technology to help make everyday projects easier to do. I hope you have the life you have always wished for.</h3>
