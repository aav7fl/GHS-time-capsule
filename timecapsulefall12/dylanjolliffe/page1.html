			Dear My future self, whats is it like to be 29 and pretty much close to getting married. Go Blue for life! How was college? So many questions don't know how to exactly say them. I hope that I lived it up and made my life to live to the fullest. I really want to know what is it like right now because I feel that it is going to be the sickest. Make sure that Iam still connecting with Scott Davis, Zach Vogel, Shawn Willard, Mike Lau, and David Cappiello. Hopefully probably living with one of them at some point.

<b>Happiness</b>- I feel that happiness is defined differently by every person and what makes you happy. I am happy when there isn't any drama going around and I am enjoying life. When life seems just perfect and that nothing couple stop it. 
			</p>
			<p>
<b>Freedom</b>- I feel that is simple to explain. It is the free rights to do what you want, that no one cant tell you what to do like a dictator.
