		      <u>The Hunger Games</u>
					<br><br>
					 The book, The Hunger Games, is set in the future where people of Panem (North America) are seperated in 12 Districts. Each District must choose one male and one female to fight against each other to the death each year. All of the Hunger Games is televised for everyone to see. In the old and poor District 12, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark were chosen as tributes to fight. They both tried not to develop a close friendship knowing there can only be one winner. Before the games started, Peeta expressed his true feelings for Katniss saying he has been in love with her. Only to find that Haymitch (their mentor) has a plan to keep them both alive.

					Song Lyrics...<u>Rules</u>
					<br><br>
	          You say you know love,
but you are just reflecting words you hear.
No iron in your veins,
to give you any sense of pain or fear.
It's just another lie,
it's just another calculation.
And when the power's out,
we're just another old sensation.
This blood* keeps me alive,
but what is it that runs through you?
Electricity and wires,
dictating everything you do.
You tell me that you hear me,
and all your memories are real.
But how do I know,
you don't just feel what you've been told to feel?
[Chorus]
We run around the rules,
we run around the rules,
we run around the rules.
'Round and around,
two by two,we run around the rules.
There's water in your eyes,
And I know I'm the reason that its there.
But still I don't feel bad,
because I know that you have more to spare.
And just behind your eyes,
are switches that can turn back on.
To clear away today,
'till all your memories are gone.
[Chorus]
We run around the rules,
we run around the rules,
we run around the rules.
'Round and around,
two by two,
we run around the rules.
We run around the rules,
we run around the rules,
we run around the rules.
(we run around the rules)
'Round and around,
two by two,
we run around the rules
