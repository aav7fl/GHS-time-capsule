					 My definition of freedom is being able to go wherever you want and nobody stopping me. Also being able to do whatever. I don't have freedom right now but I will. I get my license in less than a year, I am excited. The first step to freedom is getting a car. Once you have a car I should be able to go to a lot of different places.

My defintion of happiness is being with the people you love and doing the things you love to do. Am I happy right now?... No. You probably remember all the weeks I dreaded going to work in the morning of every weekend. I don't know what will happen you probably remember. i wonder if my future me is happy now... 10 years from now.

		       Letter to Me
					 <br>
					 <br>
					 I'm writing to myself 10 years from now. I don't really know what to say. I guess I'm wondering what you are doing right now. Are you still in college figuring out what you want to do for a living? I'm probaly going to Grand Valley right? I really wish you could answer me these questions but that's the surprise of the future.

		       Prediction of the Future
					 <br>
					 <br>
					 My prediction of the future is that there won't be flying cars or tube transportation in at least 30 years. It will be really hot by then because of global warming. For my future I think I will be in college finding what I want to do for life. Not much going on besides school.
