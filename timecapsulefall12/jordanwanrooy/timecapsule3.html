<h2> Prediction of the Future</h2>
<textarea cols="22" rows="18">
I'm not really worried about the future, it is, what it is. Or should I say will be, what it will be. 
It'll be interesting to see what new technology there is around; there've already been some pretty drastic changes in technology
of my generation. Music's always changing too, so hopefully that's just as good, if not better. The economy hasn't been doing so hot 
these past few years but what's new. Everyone will probably be arguing over politics still and how our government should be run but
hopefully the United States doesn't take a turn for the worst. I'm planning on going to college so that should be fun and I hope 
I'm doing something I enjoy and makes me happy. I want to keep in touch with family and friends and I know I'll have made plenty of
more friends along the way. Just remember to look back and appreciate the past and the presents.
