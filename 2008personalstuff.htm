 <h1><img src="/timecapsule/dolloff09/2008stuff.jpg" alt="2008"> Stuff from 2008</h1>
<p>I thought I would put some "personal" type-stuff in my time capsule to remind
me of 2008.

<P><strong>Hopes for 2019:</strong>  I hope I am.........<br>
*Driving an electric or hybrid car.<br />
*Still enjoying my teaching job, or retired and doing something I enjoy.<br />
*Helping my son go through college (probably mostly financially, :)<br />
*Still Healthy.<br />
*Looking for good stuff to read: books, comics, etc.<br />
*Playing immersive virtual-reality video games!
<P>

<td valign="top"><P><strong>My Zune,</strong> one of my favorite tech toys.  10 yrs from now it 
probably won't be much, but right now it's invaluable as a device that I 
can take my entire cd collection with me wherever I go.  It's an 80 gb model, and
as of right now I have about 15 gigs filled. I also have a few pics on it, and a couple
of videos.  Mowing the lawn or shoveling snow, this baby, as I said, is invaluable. </td>

This bumber sticker is one of my nicer ones. :)
<br />
As someone who was opposed to his policies, I'm sad to say that pretty much 
everything I feared (and much more) came true about his presidency. Perhaps in 10 years
when I'm reading this, his legacy will be better than what it looks like, but I doubt it.</p>  </td>

<td valign="top"><p><strong>Summer 2008:</strong></p> <p>Nicholas and his buddy Danny sitting by the pool discussing all
kinds of important things: who would win between 2 Pokemon, why the sky is blue,
and what Guitar Hero song is the best.</td>

<td valign="top"><p>If I were really burying things
in a time capsule, I would be an idiot not to have one of these in there.  Obama's win really was historical, 
not just in the sense of race, but also in the sense of reminding people that it really is up to us to determine our future.
I just wish that the poor guy hadn't of been handed such a crummy hand.  By the time we read this in 2019, I guess
we'll know if he was able to at least stem the tide. Good Luck to you, Mr. Obama!</p></td>

<td valign="top"><p>Picking out my fav t-shirt is really a tough call, since I have so many. KISS? Judas Priest? Thor? Metallica?....it's a toss up, so I'm gonna 
do exactly that, and toss this Iron Maiden shirt into my capsule.  It's a pretty new shirt, I bought it at Hot Topic sometime in the 
last year or so, even tho' it's a retro shirt from the Powerslave era.  It's cool.</p></td>

<td valign="top"><P>Of course, It would be remiss of me to not have a picture of the most important people in the world to me. This wasn't taken in 2008, I think it was 2006,
but it has Nitro in it, and he has since passed on to that great dog kingdom in the sky.  </td></tr>
