A Child called it would have to be my favorite piece of literature it is a very sad story and its also a true story. Its about a boy who gets abused by his mother everyday
and he blames himself for it he always thinks he deserves it because he is being bad. His mom wouldnt ever really let him eat he had to earn his food and when he got some
it would just be scraps. He would still food out of the trash at lunch, eventually his mom caught on to that and she made him puke every time he came home from school just
to make sure he didnt eat. It is a very sad story it really makes you appreciate what you have. This book has a whole series including the second book "the lost boy" and "man named dave."
