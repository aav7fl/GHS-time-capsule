		 <center><h3>SONG</h3></center>
		 Most popular song currently on the top 100 is "Someone I used to know" by
		 Gotye featuring Kimbra. I love this song listened to it like 200 times after
		 I first heard it. Now its very old and annoying but I still like it. It was made
		 in the summer of 2011 and for some reason now it's getting attention. It is 
		 a very good song, music video is something else.

		 This was probably the biggest movie that was released during my child hood. 
		 Released in December of 2009 it had the biggest buzz before it came out. Everyone 
		 was talking about how amazing it was going to be because it took 7 years to make
		 or something like that. I went and saw it in 3D with my dad, and yes it was as
		 amazing as it was said to be. It was a great movie. Now in 2012 I am just waiting
		 to see the next two movies scheduled to come in in 2014 and 2015.

		 <center><h3>LITERATURE</h3></center>
		 As much as I disliked everyone freaking out about these books, its
		 still the biggest literature craze I know. The Twilight books caused everyone
		 to just go crazy over teenage vampire love. Personally I couln't stand it.
		 But the books are supposily good. Whatever.
