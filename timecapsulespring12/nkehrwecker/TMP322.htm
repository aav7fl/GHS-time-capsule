					 <p>Hey Nick, it's the 15 year old you. I know you'll be reading this in ten years, so you better have gone to college by then. And make that game like you have been wanting to! 
					 At least start it now if you haven't. And don't be stupid and start drinking, doing drugs, or any of that dumb stuff. If you finished college, it should be for music, or for computer's.
					 And if your a teacher for either, you better be a fun teacher. So your students don't hate you.</p>
					 <br>
					 <h3>Happiness </h3>
					 Your definition of happiness should be enjoying your life, not doing drugs or any other stupid stuff. And spending a lot of time with family, and your girlfriend if you haven't married her yet.
					 <br>
					 <br>
					 <h3>Freedom</h3>
					 Your freedom is living your life how you want, not how others want you too. Doing what you want, and what you love.
	   			 <br>
					 <br>
					 <h3>Technology</h3>
					 Tech should be very interesting in ten years from when you wrote this, and you better keep up with it. It could change in the blink of an eye. And if there are flying cars by then, try to get one. 
					 Because that would be awesome.
