		 <h3><i><u>WHAT IS FREEDOM TO YOU? WHAT DEFINES YOU TO BE TRULY "FREE"?</u></i></h3>
		 <br>
		 <h3><i>Freedom, (to me), isn't some word that can be caged in labels like "the
		 power to act", or "right to think/speak,etc.". It can't be rolled over like
		 trash from the higher-ups, and locked away forever because most think it will
		 endanger all of society". That's just selfish thinking. For what they think is chaos,
		 I believe is order. 
		 <p>
		 <br>
		 Think about it. 
		 <p>
		 <br>
		 When we are born and we take in our first painful ounce of life, we feel alive.
		  Free, almost because we've escaped from our mother's womb to experience what
			the outside world holds for us. Sure, after so those many years of coddling and
			teaching are drilled into our minds, we feel trapped again. Almost like our "wings"
			have been clipped for the second time in order to prevent us from taking 
			off into a world unknown. But in those painful attempts to fly again, we
			begin to hope; we begin to believe. We take for granted what freedom can
			feel lke. It can feel like a million hearts ar beating within one body. It
			can feel like the times that were good, and sometimes the bad. 
			<p>
			<br>
			Freedom isn't the word that you can easily search for in a dictionary. Maybe
			it isn't even what I believe. To me, freedom is the writhing, caged animal
			ready to take flight.

	          	 <h3><u><i>Define "happiness"</i></u></h3>
							 <br>
							 <h4><i>Happiness? Well, I'm not quite sure about what happiness
							 <u>truly</u></i> is since I've never experienced it full on. Sure,
							  getting the things you want and actually enjoying them for a while
								 could seem like happiness... but is it really? I mean, we take
								 for granted what we believe is really happiness. Things like
								 getting a job after so long, finding the "right one", buying
								 that new game system, etc., etc.
								 <br>
								 But those are just wants, and temporary spikes. Not <u>real</u>
								 happiness. If I were to summarize it, I'd say happiness is that
								 feeling when your soul; your inner self, knows that what is going 
								 on is making you smile.</h4>
