		 <h3><i>Hey, new and old Web Design students! Nate here for one of my very 
		 last pages before taking on life after graduating GHS. This class has been 
		 real fun, (but at times, a real pain with all the typing and memorization, 
		 blah, blah, blah. (You get what I'm saying, eh?) Unlike my other pages, this
		  page is a reminder for myself, not a page just about a certain topic. 
			Think of this as kind of another "About Me" page, only with a letter about
			 how I think my life will change 10 years from now, and where I think life
			  will take me later down the road.</i></h3><p><br>
		 <h3><i>For starters, I should start with the letter to myself. YO! FUTURE ME! TAKE NOTES!!!</i></h3><hr>
		 <br>
		 <h4><i>To the future <u>Nathan Djomoah</u>,<p><br>
		 Hey, man. How's it going? Pretty nostalgic for someone like you to be seeing
		  this page again, huh? I mean, wow! Look at this! It's like reading one of 
			those old Ted Dekker books that you loved so much, (and probably still do),
			 and reliving every moment one word at a time. It may seem pretty funny 
			 that you even remember creating a webpage. Probably has been about almost
			  ten years, I'd say? And in those ten years, I suppose a lot will change.
				 You'll find yourself a grilfriend, (later your wife), be writing those 
				 "hard-to-understand-yet-awesome" novels, enjoying as much of life as you
				  can, (hell, maybe even going out and actually finding some of your good
					 old friends you used to know!), et cetra, et cetra...But even in those
					  good moments, you'll probably lose alot too. Like time, for one thing.
						 Time has always been a big problem for you. Never felt like you could
						  get anything accomplished in those remaining minutes you had, always
							 fretting out over every single second "wasted". And that's another
							 thing. Your fretting and "freaking out". Like how our mother always
							 told us, "Keep that anger in control.". Even now as an almost "free"
							 man before graduation, I can tell that the anger may become another
							 demon to handle. I know it's rough, probably even utterly frustrating
							 to keep it in check, but PLEASE remember: you're going to be a father
							 someday; a husband to a loving wife; a brother and son to a caring
							 family, and a strong friend to all you meet. And as far as I can tell,
							 you wouldn't want that anger to turn into something nastier. It 
							 may seem like a warning, but remember those around you don't want
							 you to become a monster. (Just a BIG reminder, yeah?) Also, take
							 care of your family, eh? And remember, (and God I know this is
							 something you REALLY don't want to do), talk to Dad. I don't care
							 if you hate his guts because of all the mistakes he's done...and
							 I especially don't care if you want to seclude yourself and become
							 a whining, lonely, antisocial S.O.B because of <u>your</u> past
							 "mistakes". Just try to talk with the man. He's your father. You
							 can't escape that reality. Sure, he may be a coward, but he's family.
							 It's time you started treating him like one.
							 <p>
							 <br>
							 Well, I think it's about time I stopped typing and started with
							 the rest of the time capsule. Oh! Maybe there's a few more things
							 I need to say before going on.
							 <p>
							 <br>
							 1) Read some books other than Ted Dekker. I know you think he's
							 an awesome writer, but try to read something other than "Showdown"
							 <p>
							 2) If you're ever stuck with any of your stories, go out and talk
							 with your brother. Remember all those times he's critiqued and
							 helped in all those ideas that were crap? He's a good suggestion.
							 That, or go outside for once and visit some places.
							 <p>
							 3)Have fun with life. And be yourself. Don't be that wimp who
							 doesn't stick up for what he likes. Challenge yourself. Challenge
							 the world! Be who you want to be, not what society wants you to be.
							 <p>
							 <br>
							 Signing off, <u>Nathan Kwame "Djomama" Djomoah</u>
